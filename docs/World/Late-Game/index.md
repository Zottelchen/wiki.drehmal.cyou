!!! danger "This section of the wiki is about a late-game area, discovered as part of the 75% completion event. If you have not yet reached this milestone and completed the sequence, **ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO THE "Apotheosis" ADVANCEMENT**, then reading further in this section may spoil what is intended to be among the largest discoveries in the game. If this is the case, we strongly advise that you navigate to another part of the site."

If you have already completed this sequence, then this section contains world exploration info on the area unlocked after this milestone in roughly the same format as the World/Drehmal section, breaking down the area into regions, notable POIs, and settlements.
