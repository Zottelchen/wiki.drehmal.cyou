The town is home to a [[Runic Blacksmith]]. This Runic Blacksmith sells [[Artisan Item#Riverstead Town|one artisan item]], a crossbow named "Ol' Reliable". This crossbow is purchased using the Corewood Pulverizer, another Artisan item sold by the blacksmith in [[Helmshire]], in [[Spearhead Forest]]. The lore text of the former establishes that the population of Riverstead Town came from Helmshire, and that this Runic Blacksmith was once the teacher of the one in Helmshire.

The people of Riverstead Town are likely the Drehmari who left Helmshire in recent years following a string of disappearances, making their way north to the stump portal. This portal would have placed them in northern [[Vayniklah's Domain]], where they likely followed the river south until they were away from the hostile entities present throughout that region.
