**Lajani** is a town in the center of [[Noha's Domain]], built around the skeleton of [[Noha|the Aspect herself]].

!!! abstract "Location"
    Approximate Coordinates: `935, 49, -270`

The town is almost entirely contained by a winding river, which surrounds it on all sides except the south. Lajani is the only part of the region which is not a barren, dead wasteland, as it remains a thriving, albeit isolated, farming town to this day.

## Layout/Points of Interest

Lajani's buildings are made of simple wood and moss/grass roofs, similar to [[Drabyel]]. It is filled with various patches of flowers and wheat. The skeleton of Noha, the Aspect of Harvest, lays in the village, with some homes even built inside of her ribcage.

There are four particularly notable pieces of loot in Lajaniâ€”the books [[Mili's Curiosity]], [[The Remnant Breadbasket]], and [[Mother's Pride]], and the [[Artifacts#Harvester's Overalls|Harvester's Overalls]] artifact.

Despite being a notable settlement, there is no [[Runic Blacksmith]] in this town.

## Lore

Per [[Mili's Curiosity]], Lajani was once the single most populated (and most powerful) city in all of Lo'Dahr, prior to Noha's death. However, with her death after the [[Frostfang Catastrophe]], which appears to have occurred right here, the vast majority of the town's population left. While the rest of the region once known as the Golden Steppe grew corrupted and contaminated, the land around Lajani remained fertile, powered by some combination of the innate magic in Noha's body and her actual flesh as fertilizer. It has kept the remnants of Lajani fed and safe for over a millennium at this point, and it seems that the rest of the moon has largely forgotten about them.
