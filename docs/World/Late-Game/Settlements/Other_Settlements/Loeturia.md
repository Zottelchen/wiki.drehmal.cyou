**Loeturia** is a settlement in western [[Loe's Domain]], easily distinguishable for its large blackstone wall. It is, notably, the site of one of Lo'Dahr's two [[gates]] that can be opened from the moon side, as well as the source of one of the hints on how to do so.

Loeturia is home to four lore books and a [[Runic Blacksmith]].

## Layout

Loeturia is built at the base of a large hill in the west of Loe's Domain, and is mostly contained by a large blackstone brick wall, forming a box shape. Homes are built around the wall's inner edges, around the main entrance to the east. The centerpiece of the town is an ice rink, with lines very reminiscent of a hockey rink or soccer field.

Steps on either wall lead up to the main feature of the town, a large temple-like structure with one large room. In the center of this room is one of the quartz [[gates]] found throughout Drehmal and Lo'Dahr, inactive.

A [[Runic Blacksmith]] is located in a tent in the southeast corner, selling [[Artisan Items#Loeturia|two artisan items]].

## Lore

Loeturia was once the only place on Lo'Dahr where non-ascended [[Drehmari]] were allowed to live alongside the local [[Tehrmari]]. During the time of [[Avsohm]], the empire built the [[Inscription Complex]] just outside of the town, and there was notable tension between their forces and the Tehrmari locals. However, the town appears to have remained open to Drehmari after the empire's fall, although they were asked to remain inside the walls. Eventually, large influxes of Drehmari migrants forced the town to build homes beyond their walls, expanding into the dangers of the surrounding biome, and the village elders made the decision to shut down the portal.
