## Description { data-search-exclude }

![[rihelma_starrise.png]]

**Rihelma's Domain** is one of 14 Aspect Domains on [[Lo'Dahr]], belonging to the Elder Sky Aspect [[Rihelma]]. This domain has three distinct sub-regions, tied together by the presence of floating islands of varying size, up until the Star-Rise, the largest mountain in the realm, at the southern edge of the domain. The region sits in the far southeastern portion of Lo'Dahr's habitable area, bordering [[Voynahla's Domain]] and [[Palaesida's Domain]] to the west, as well as [[Nahyn's Domain]] and [[Noha's Domain]] to the north.

## Geography

Rihelma's Domain can be easily divided into three distinct sub-regions, from the north to the south.

![[rihelma_floating.png]]

Terrain in the north is barren, having formerly been an extension of the sea fed by continuous rainstorms in Palaesida's Domain, directly to its west. In the modern day, this sea has almost completely dried up, and the northern portion of the region is mostly made up of the empty basin. However, floating islands and giant amethyst crystals are also found in this region, and the major points of interest in this sub-region are all found high above the ground level.

Terrain in the middle of the region is hillier and grassy, covered in an extremely thick canopy formed by jungle and acacia trees. Floating islands are also found in this sub-region, with little to be discovered below the trees.

In the far south of the region lies possibly the most iconic landmark in all of Lo'Dahr: the **Star-Rise**, also known as **Aldregakar**. Aldregakar is the tallest mountain in the entire realm of Drehmal (including the overworld), and is large enough to be considered its own sub-region. Atop the massive plateau, custom basalt trees provide sparse vegetation, and multiple lakes from the summit flow down the face of the mountain to feed other bodies of water nearby. 

## Gameplay

Reaching the floating islands in Rihelma's Domain can be quite difficult, as some are over 100 blocks above ground level. Simply towering up with blocks can be effective, although flying enemies in the region are known to knock off players who attempt to do so. Players may also try to climb in smaller increments to other islands and then glide between them, or even climb to the top of Aldregakar and then glide north to the main islands using [[Avsohm'Kohl]]. Some islands also have columns of water falling from them which can be swam up, but this can also be difficult due to hostile mob spawns.

Custom dark blue llama variants known as "**Moon Llamas**" spawn in this region.

Multiple types of custom enemies can also spawn in Rihelma's Domain.

| **Description** | Phoenixes are custom flaming phantoms that spawn in this region. Similar to the mythological creatures from which they take their name, phoenixes can be resurrected, dissolving into a small pile of fire particles upon their first death. They will be revived after a few seconds, and upon their second death, will not revive again. Phoenixes do not resurrect if their ashes (the pile of particles) touches any kind of water—if it is raining, Phoenixes cannot revive, and players may place down a water bucket on a Phoenix's ashes to kill it for good. Phoenixes can also spawn with a skeleton riding them, in which case the skeleton is known as an **Ashen Rider**.   |

| **Description** | Bright Revelers are custom skeletons, which shoot alternating kinds of tipped arrows. During the day, these mobs shoot flaming arrows, and at night, they shoot arrows which inflict 3 seconds of Blindness. On death, Bright Revelers can drop either flaming arrows or tipped arrows which inflict 11 seconds of Blindness—whichever type they were holding when killed. These mobs are found in large numbers alongside Pale Revelers, especially in the northern portion of the region.  |

| **Image**  | ![[pale_reveler.png]]{ width="100" }  |
| **Description** | Pale Revelers are custom zombies, whose stats change depending on the time of day. During the day, these zombies have a base movement speed of 0.32 and Knockback Resistance of 1.0, making them incredibly fast and immune to knockback. During the night, however, their movement speed lowers to 0.23, and their knockback resistance drops all the way to 0. Being hurt by a Pale Reveler at any time of day will lift the player into the air by granting them 1 second of the Levitation VI effect. These mobs are found in large numbers alongside Bright Revelers, especially in the northern portion of the region. |

Atop Aldregakar's summit in particular, there are 5 exposed amethyst geodes. Each of these geodes holds a chest with valuable loot (typically diamonds, enchanted books, and/or celestial chondrules), but approaching them will spawn in a miniboss duo, the Solar Envoy and Lunar Envoy. The Lunar Envoy is a custom zombie wearing full diamond armor and armed with two diamond swords, sporting a very high 170 base health. The Solar Envoy is a custom flaming skeleton riding a phantom, who will shoot arrows at the player from above. If both envoys at a location are killed, they will not respawn. Envoys will despawn after a few seconds if the player is not within a 25-block radius of their guarded location, and instantly if the player leaves a 55-block radius.

## History

Rihelma's Domain was the location of [[Avsohm]]'s initial landing on the divine moon, at the location that would quickly become the [[Resupply Depot]]. The empire made this location the center of their operations on the moon until the establishment of the [[Core Facility]], and this region remained important for Avsohmic operations until [[Fall of Avsohm|their fall]].

The floating island town of Rihanar, also in the northern portion of the region, was once the third-largest city in all of Lo'Dahr, but its inhabitants all mysteriously vanished one day, leaving a mostly-intact city. Other settlements have been made in Rihelma's Domain, tending to take shelter from the hostile creatures on the ground floor by living either on floating islands or within the Star-Rise.

## Points of Interest

### Augural Tangle

The [[Augural Tangle]] is a massive cavern inside of the southern portion of Aldregakar, full of crystals that are said to give a glimpse into the prophetic visions of [[Rihelma|Elder Rihelma]] as she receives them. The Tangle is not directly accessible without breaking blocks, but a hidden cavern at the bottom of the waterfall in the center of Aldregakar provides the best access point. The [[Aeongale]] legendary item is located here, in addition to an [[Artifacts#Iker Harvester|artifact]].

**Coordinates:** (X: 931, Y: 51, Z: 1118)

### Carl's House

Off the southeastern face of Aldregakar, a house can be found floating in the air, seemingly suspended by hundreds of multicolored wool blocks. This is, of course, a reference to the Pixar movie "Up," in which the protagonist, Carl, floats his house to the wilderness of South America with the use of helium balloons. This house contains [[Old Motto|a book]] with another "Up" reference, and a Khivian Scroll of Sanctuary.

**Coordinates:** (X: 1288, Y: 177, Z: 1317)

### Glass Dome

Near the northern border with Noha's Domain, a strange, large white/purple tower can be found, reminiscent of but not identical to the Avsohmic [[Terminus Network|Terminus]] towers. Atop the tower is a massive purple stained glass dome, encasing a warped nylium environment and a small, simple house with a single loot chest.

**Coordinates:** (X: 971, Y: 64, Z: 208)

### Resupply Depot

The [[Resupply Depot]] was the [[Avsohm|Avsohmic Empire]]'s shipping hub and spaceport on Lo'Dahr, and the site of their first lunar landing. This is one of the five [story locations on Lo'Dahr](/Story_and_Features/Story_Locations/Post-75_Locations/).

**Coordinates:** (X: 1192, Y: 149, Z: 328)

### Ruins of Rihanar

[[Rihanar]] is a now-abandoned city resting atop a large, floating island in the northern portion of the region. [[Artifacts#Phoenixfeather Cloak|One artifact]] found here tells the city's story.

**Coordinates:** (X: 833, Y: 237, Z: 600)

### Sculptors' Settlement

What looks like a small landing pad protrudes out of the northeastern face of Aldregakar. Following its path inside the mountain, one will find a small [[Tehrmari]] dwelling, made up of sculptors who live entirely within the Star-Rise.

**Coordinates:** (X: 1304, Y: 144, Z: 861)

### Star-Rise Orrery

The [[Star-Rise Orrery]] is a massive, elaborate planetarium/orrery found inside of the eastern portion of Aldregakar. It is the site of Rihelma's [Trial](/World/Late-Game/Points_of_Interest/Trials/).

**Coordinates:** (X: 1084, Y: 82, Z: 895)

### Summit-Top Orrery

A smaller orrery is also found at the top of Aldregakar, within a small lake/pond. This location contains [[The Pilgrimage of Rihelma|one lore book]] and two loot chests, one of which is hidden inside of the orrery's [[Torahn]] (the glowstone orb).

**Coordinates:** (X: 1115, Y: 243, Z: 1125)

## Extras

The design of Aldregakar is heavily inspired by [Mount Roraima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Roraima) in Venezuela. Angel Falls, the world's tallest uninterrupted waterfall, is also located on a similar mountain in Venezuela, and served as inspiration for the setting of the movie "Up". This draws yet another connection between this film and Drehmal's take on the same kind of location!
