![[khive_domain.png]]

**Khive's Domain** is one of 14 Aspect Domains on [[Lo'Dahr]], belonging to the most powerful of the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/), the Mystic Elder [[Khive]]. This region is made up overwhelmingly of black and yellow hills, and is littered with mysterious red sandstone rings. The region sits in the far west and northwestern portion of Lo'Dahr's habitable area, bordering [[Vayniklah's Domain]] to the east and [[Dahr's Domain]] to the south.

## Geography

Khive's Domain makes up approximately the northern half of Lo'Dahr's western edge, stretching from the northwest corner of the habitable zone down to the swamp of Dahr's Domain, broken into northern and southern halves by a river that belongs to Vayniklah's Domain. The terrain is hilly, and often somewhat barren, with only red sandstone rings and custom black/yellow trees adding variety to most of the landscape.

**Environmental Sub-Regions:** 

- Large bowl in the northern portion, filled with custom black and yellow/orange trees and a single winding stream, centered around Ihted Academy. <br>
- Treeless hillside southeast of the former sub-region, separated by mountains. Populated by more rings, and home to the Mystic Gallery. <br>
- Small marsh in the center of the region, draining east into a river in Vayniklah's Domain. <br>
- Rolling black and yellow hills in the southern portion, with sparse trees.

In the northern half of the biome, a small stream begins at a statue of the Mystic Elder, and winds around in a circle down to a marsh, where the water drains into the western river of Vayniklah's Domain. The only notable body of water in the south is Lake Khanak, a large lake with the ruins of a small fishing village on its southern shore and a [[Ring Facility|massive Avsohmic facility]] in its center.

There are no surviving settlements in Khive's Domain.

## Gameplay

Black Pseudodragons can be found in Khive's Domain.

There are multiple custom enemies found in Khive's Domain, most notably two custom zombie variants. Neither of these zombie variants take damage from the sun in daytime like vanilla zombies.

| **Image**  | ![[blinker.png]]{ width="100" }  |
| **Description** | Blinkers appear as light blue zombies wearing a white toga, with a singular yellow eye encompassing nearly its entire face. These enemies often spawn in packs when out in the fields of Khive's Domain. When a Blinker is hit, it will disappear in a flash of light green particles, remaining invisible and being given a speed boost for 3 seconds, typically resulting in it appearing somewhere else nearby. |

| **Description** | Glimpses appear as light pink/red zombies wearing a white toga, with a singular yellow/purple eye. Glimpses are rarer than Blinkers, but deal significantly more damage and follow a different mechanic. Glimpses will pursue a player over long distances up to 100 blocks, but they will only be able to move if they are not being actively observed. Glimpses will keep their eyes firmly shut if a player is looking at them, and will stand still when doing so, but they will open their eye and attack if the player looks away. |
| **Notes**  | The "Glimpse Into the Cosmos" advancement is granted for bringing a Glimpse to the top of Aldregakar in [[Rihelma's Domain]]. In the datapack, Glimpses are referred to as "173," referencing SCP-173, a fictional monster that also cannot move while being watched. |

Mihkmari Arcanists (Evokers) can also spawn naturally in Khive's Domain, and custom enemies known as Shackled Sentinels are found at [[Ihted Academy]].

## History

The first clear historical event in Khive's Domain likely came in the First Avihm, with the transplanting of [[Ihted Academy]] onto Lo'Dahr, where it is found today. On modern Drehmal, the ruins of a town named [[Ihted]] do exist in eastern [[Capital Valley]], but this town is believed to have dated back to early Av2, and was named after an even larger, more influential city from the First Avihm. It is likely that Ihted Academy was part of this first city, and was the place where Khive first taught runic magic to mortals in Av1. It is not clear exactly what transpired here, but it is very strongly hinted that Khive's teaching of magic to mortals is his greatest regret, and the advancement for finding this location calls the academy "the source of [Khive's] greatest sorrow." This points to some kind of catastrophe involving Khive teaching magic to [[Drehmari]], likely involving [[Aok]] and his attempt at the [[Ambition]], which prompted Khive to pull Ihted Academy onto his domain, unwilling to destroy all of the knowledge kept within.

Khive's Domain was also the site of significant Avsohmic operations in the Second Avihm, during their time on the moon. The [[Ring Facility|Warp Ring Research Installation]] first began as a hydroelectric power plant in Lake Khanak, damaging the environment and causing tensions with the [[Tehrmari]] who lived in the area, but they were never explicitly pushed out by Khive. Eventually, Avsohm studied and reverse-engineered the runes from Khive's warp rings found around the region, and fully converted the power plant into a facility for ring research. This would lead to Avsohm's eventual establishment of a [[Terminus Network|continent-wide warp network]]. A book titled [[Dread of the Ageless]] describes the events at this facility during the [[Fall of Avsohm]], in which a massive beast manifested in the sky, took the form of a drill, and descended upon the facility, killing every Avsohmic officer inside.

At some point after this, the village on Lake Khanak was abandoned, and to this day, there are no remaining settlements in Khive's Domain.
