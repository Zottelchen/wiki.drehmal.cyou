## Description { data-search-exclude }

![[loe_domain.png]]

**Loe's Domain** is one of 14 Aspect Domains on [[Lo'Dahr]], belonging to the Aspect of Cold, Glacial Elder [[Loe]]. This region is completely frozen over, with several unique structures found throughout its snowy expanse. The region sits in the far southwest of Lo'Dahr's habitable area, encircled partially by [[Dahr's Domain]] and partially by the [[Lunar Wastes]].

 Grass blocks appear purple when placed in Loe's Domain, as seen towards the eastern border with Dahr's Domain.

## Geography

Loe's Domain takes a roughly circular shape, with a central bowl surrounded by mountains. A bridge connects the region to [[Khive's Domain]] to the north, and gradual hills can serve as mountain passes to Dahr's Domain in the east.

Loe's Domain is, true to its patron Aspect, incredibly cold, being entirely covered in snow and ice. Custom structures are also found throughout the biome, most notably in the form of multicolored concrete pyramids on the ground and streaks of glass in the sky, representing the aurora. The pyramids have no known origin or purpose.

There do not truly appear to be distinct sub-regions in Loe's Domain, although there are some notably different landforms. There are three large glaciers in the region (one southwest and two north), and there is a large frozen lake in the east.

The town of [[Loeturia]] is found in the west of this region.

## Gameplay

Loe's Domain can be somewhat treacherous to traverse due to the presence of powder snow blocks mixed in with regular snow. Therefore, wearing leather boots may be a worthwhile precaution when visiting Loe's Domain, or players may choose to avoid walking over snow as much as possible.

Polar Bears (called "Faehrbears" by the resource pack) and blue Pseudodragons spawn in Loe's Domain.

There are also two custom enemies found in this biome.

| **Description** | Burrowers are custom spiders which spawn naturally in this region. They have a white body to blend in with the snow, and light blue eyes. True to their name, Burrowers will burrow into snow/powder snow blocks, emitting faint particles above blocks where they have nested, and will ambush players by popping out and attacking them when approached. Burrowers inflict 6 seconds of poison if they hit a player.  |

| **Image**  | ![[freorig.png]]{ width="100" }  |
| **Description** | Custom iron golems named **Freorigs** also spawn in Loe's Domain. These golems are incredibly strong, and give any players in their vicinity a slowness effect, simulating the chill that surrounds them. Freorigs also possess an attack that shoots ice spikes out of the ground, very similar to the "fang" attack used by vanilla Evokers.  |
| **Notes** | The "Bundled Up" advancement is given for attempting to neutralize a Freorig's chill AoE by wearing a leather chestplate. |

## History

Loe's Domain is home to [[Loeturia]], one of the only places where [[Drehmari]] were traditionally allowed to live on Lo'Dahr. Eventually, however, an influx of Drehmari migrants led to the village's elders deciding to shut the portal, preventing any more Drehmari from entering.

Loe's Domain is also home to the [[Inscription Complex]], a facility that was crucial to the [[Avsohm|Avsohmic Empire]]'s lunar operations. As inscribed runic catalysts could not be teleported from [[Overworld|Drehmal]] to the moon without the risk of violently exploding, catalysts had to be inscribed locally. The divine ice of Loe's Domain was especially useful in neutralizing the heat generated in the process of inscribing catalysts, and so the Inscription Complex was built in this region, just south of the settlement of Loeturia. This led to significant tensions between the Tehrmari locals and Avsohm.

The region is also home to Greyspire Castle, a location that is shrouded in mystery but appears to have great significance to the realm. Greyspire contains multiple books that attempt to grasp at the fundamental truths behind the universe, and was rumored to be the home of one of the most powerful [[arcanism|arcanists]] alive. It has been speculated to have connections to [[Aok]]. The castle is still standing and inhabited today, and most of the villagers of Loeturia avoid it out of fear.

## Points of Interest

### Catalyst Inscription Complex

The [[Inscription Complex]] is an Avsohmic facility built on the underside of a glacier in the southwestern portion of Loe's Domain, where [[Avsohm]] inscribed their runic catalysts for use in local operations. This is one of the five [story locations on Lo'Dahr](/Story_and_Features/Story_Locations/Post-75_Locations/).

### Greyspire Castle

[[Greyspire Castle]] is a castle found atop a mountain in the north of Loe's Domain. This location is home to several lore books with significant implications, an [[Artifacts#Luminous Diadem|artifact]], and a [[Fervor Stones#Stone of Worry|Stone of Worry]]. 

**Coordinates:** (X: -840, Y: 179, Z: 583)

### Loeturia

[[Loeturia]] is a walled town found in the west of Loe's Domain, and one of the largest settlements on Lo'Dahr. This is one of the only locations on the moon with [[Drehmari]] inhabitants, and is home to a quartz gateway. A book here, titled [[The Elders' Decision]], offers one of the two major hints in the map towards the activation method for these structures.
