## Description { data-search-exclude }

![[lunar_wastes.png]]

The **Lunar Wastes** are the region outside of [[Lo'Dahr]]'s habitable area. In this area, cosmic rays are much stronger, and will deal significant damage to the player if they enter. This makes it effectively impossible to navigate this area without switching to Creative/Spectator Mode or enabling NoFail mode in the `/trigger Settings` menu. There are no points of interest to be found in the Lunar Wastes themselves aside from minor easter eggs.

## Geography

The Lunar Wastes are desolate, barren, and gray, made up almost entirely of a mixture of stone, gravel, light gray concrete powder, gray concrete, and deepslate. Occasional craters can be found in the landscape, revealing bits of Otherstone (end stone) deeper underground, as well as blackstone. 

To the far northwest, there is a patch of land which is mostly Otherstone, in a rough elliptical pattern. It is possible that this is where the [[Akhlo'Rohma#Sunken Astral Body|Sunken Astral Body]] was once located.

## Gameplay

When in the Wastes, players gain temporary Slow Falling III and Jump Boost IV effects.

Entering the Lunar Wastes while in Survival or Adventure Mode will give the player the message `Cosmic rays sear your skin...` in red text over their hotbar. After about 4-5 seconds of standing in the Wastes, the player will begin to take damage from these cosmic rays, which cannot be blocked or alleviated by standing in water.

The time for this damage to kill the player depends on their armor. The cosmic rays will kill an unarmored player in approximately 6 seconds. A full set of unenchanted diamond armor will protect the player for about 14 seconds from the time of first damage, while a full set of celestial (netherite) armor enchanted with Protection IV can keep a player alive for about 30 seconds.

Returning to a safe zone or entering Creative/Spectator Mode will give the message `The effects fade...` in green text, and no further damage will be taken.

??? warning "Lunar Wastes Exploit"
    It is possible to evade damage from the Lunar Wastes while in Survival Mode due to the way that the player is determined to be in the Wastes. The player is counted as being in the Lunar Wastes if they are in the Snowy Taiga biome, but above the build limit, there are no biomes. Therefore, if a player is able to remain above the build limit, they can avoid taking damage while in the Lunar Wastes. This can be done by bowboosting using [[Artifacts#Sharksbane|Sharksbane]] and [[Avsohm'Kohl]], a technique that has been utilized by speedrunners.

In order to prevent softlocking, beds are set to explode if placed and used in the Lunar Wastes.

## Points of Interest

### MoonDonalds

![[moondonalds.png]]

MoonDonalds is an easter egg location, found in the far eastern Lunar Wastes, roughly due east of [[Lajani]]. It is a parody of a McDonalds restaurant, and contains numerous easter eggs inside, including a bee named "HiscottiBeescotti" (a reference to developer HiscottiBiscotti), a [[Cat Maps|Priscilla picture]], and several other humorous named items.

MoonDonalds is too far into the Lunar Wastes to reach without the use of cheats, NoFail, or exploits.

### Mysterious Symbol

Off the western boundary of [[Khive's Domain]] is a small pool, the only source of naturally occurring water in the Lunar Wastes. Inside of this pool, players can find a small symbol, which is seen elsewhere in the map but whose meaning within the universe of Drehmal is not fully understood.

### Yriel's Sanctuary

[[Yriel's Sanctuary]] is not truly a part of the Lunar Wastes, but it is located within them. Found far to the southeast of Lo'Dahr's habitable area, this location is accessed by completing the [six Trials](/World/Late-Game/Points_of_Interest/Trials/) found around Lo'Dahr.
