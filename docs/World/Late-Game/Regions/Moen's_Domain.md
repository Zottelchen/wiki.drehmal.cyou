## Description { data-search-exclude }

![[moen_domain.png]]

**Moen's Domain** is one of 14 Aspect Domains on [[Lo'Dahr]], belonging to the Aspect of Pleasure, Kind Wyrm [[Moen]]. This region is where the player will first touch down on Lo'Dahr after the [[Aphelion]] sequence, and is home to the city of [[Naharja]]. It takes the form of a light green meadow, with modest freshwater and colorful trees. The region sits in the north-central portion of Lo'Dahr's habitable area, bordering [[Vayniklah's Domain]] to the west, [[Maen's Domain]] to the southwest, [[Nahyn's Domain]] to the south, and [[Taihgel's Domain]] to the east. A path leading due north from the region's main lake takes the player to the sacred halls of [[Ytaj]].

## Geography

Moen's Domain is generally hilly, with its terrain sloping downwards from a large mountain at its center, meeting with the lower biomes that neighbor it, transitioning smoothly to Taihgel's Domain to its east. The region is roughly rectangular, and features a large lake in its center. This lake is where the Lo'Dahr tower will land at the end of the 75% Completion Event at the [[Aphelion]], and paths lead from the west up to [[Ytaj]] or to [[Naharja]] in the east.

Colors in this region are generally bright and vivid, with heavy use of custom trees made of orange and pink wool. Grass blocks also have a light, nearly pastel shade of green in Moen's Domain. The terrain is otherwise dominated by various shades of pink, red, and white.

The city of Naharja takes up most of the northeastern portion of the region.

## Gameplay

No enemies naturally spawn in Moen's Domain, except for a rare Killer Bunny variant.

Rabbits spawn throughout the biome, including special blue variants with the name **"Moen Rabbit"**.

## History

Moen's Domain's history is closely intertwined with the history of its lone city, Naharja. Naharja has long acted as the capital of [[Tehrmari]] civilization, and particularly, the home of the La'Tehrmari, the upper class of fully ascended Tehrmari who work and live directly with the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/). 

One of the most significant factions in Tehrmari history, the [[Rohei|Roheian Empire]], was born out of two groups who were ousted from Naharja after engaging in bloody battles in the city's streets.

Modern Naharja has a less strict hierarchy in place, with Ro'Tehrmari heavily outnumbering the ascended La'Tehrmari in the city.

## Terminus Tower

The [[Terminus Network|Terminus]] tower in Maen's Domain is the only tower on all of Lo'Dahr, and only appears when the player has dropped it from the [[Aphelion]] during the 75% completion event. The tower lands in the center of a lake in the western portion of the region, with paths leading west to [[Ytaj]] and east to [[Naharja]].
