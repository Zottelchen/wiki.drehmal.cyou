# Coven of Alchemists

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

The **Coven of Alchemists** is the name given to a group of [alchemists](/Lore/Magic/Alchemy/) that inhabited a castle in [[Maen's Domain]], as well as the name used to refer to that castle.

Significant, unethical research into the three Primal Emotions—Pain, Pleasure, and Fear—was done here, learning that eliciting these emotions releases [[Primal Energy]] from souls.
