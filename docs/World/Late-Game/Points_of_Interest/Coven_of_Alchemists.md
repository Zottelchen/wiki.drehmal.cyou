The **Coven of Alchemists** is the name given to a group of [alchemists](Alchemy.md) that inhabited a castle in [[Maen's Domain]], as well as the name used to refer to that castle.

Significant, unethical research into the three Primal Emotions—Pain, Pleasure, and Fear—was done here, learning that eliciting these emotions releases [[Primal Energy]] from souls.

## Layout

The building is made almost entirely of slate bricks. From the main entrance in the north, which features a statue of a figure holding a sword, a staircase to the right leads up to a room holding the [[The Primal Emotions]] book, and then connects to another downwards staircase. 

The basement of the facility seems to be where Pain was studied. Various torture devices are found, as well as brewing setups with a noxious substance named "Odium" and a set of prison cells. The [[Pain]] book sits on a lectern in these rooms.

Returning to the main hall and climbing around the left side of the room, a narrow, partially collapsed staircase leads upwards to the rest of the castle. Staying on this level for a moment, a room with bunks can be found on this side, with the [[Pleasure]] book in an item frame.

At the top of the staircase, a ladder leads upwards to a collapsed passage. Dig through to find a room with the [[Artifacts#Involuntary Ranged Injection Mechanism|Involuntary Ranged Injection Mechanism]] artifact.

Climbing the castle through a series of rooms and stairways, players will come to a small balcony, with a chest holding the [[Fear]] book.

Spawners in this area will spawn invisible zombies with custom heads, bearing the name "Emotion Sprite".

A large ballista is positioned on the top of the building, pointed to the east towards [[Fort Aelon]].

## Lore

This building was home to a coven of alchemists, who performed experiments on other Tehrmari in order to determine the nature of the Primal Emotions. Through their experimentation, they were able to determine that Fear, Pain, and Pleasure were the three Primal Emotions, in addition to more information about them.

Through the experiments here, the alchemists learned that when people experience any of these three emotions, their souls give off small, but palpable amounts of [[Primal Energy]].

The applications of this were many: torture facilities used pain to extract and store large amounts of primal energy, pleasure was found to be useful in the refinement of Primal Energy into usable forms, and the process was completed by using the refined primal energy to create a truth serum.

The allegiance of this group is not entirely clear, and may have changed over time. The Involuntary Ranged Injection Mechanism was created by a Ro'Tehrmari member of the Coven and used to attack a member of the Talon, but the serum created to force subjects to tell the truth while interrogated was developed by the Coven for the Talon's use.
