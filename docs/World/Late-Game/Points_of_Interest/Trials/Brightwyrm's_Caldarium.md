**Brightwyrm's Caldarium** is the site of [[Lai|Brightwyrm Lai]]'s [Trial](/World/Post-75_Area/Points_of_Interest/Trials/). It is accessed through a gate at the top of the volcanic caldera in [[Lai's Domain]].

    On Lo'Dahr, these coordinates correspond to the entrance to the Caldarium.

## Lai's Trial
Descending through a long tunnel from this entrance will bring the player to the Caldarium, playing the following message in chat:

> The heat in the air seems to lessen as your mind begins to course with hyperactive, bursting energy.

This is accompanied by the "Brightwyrm's Caldarium" advancement.

The player will find themselves in a room with the above mural, depicting four differently-colored flames in either corner, along with a sign that reads:

> IN MAGMA'S EMBRACE BETWEEN FOUR FLAMES

The room then opens up into a much larger, lava-filled room, with sparse ruined bridges. The player remains in Survival Mode, and can place blocks.

??? question "Light Hint"
    Looking up to the ceiling may provide all the information necessary to complete this puzzle, especially when referring to the starting mural. Some knowledge of vanilla Minecraft's lava mechanics (or fluid mechanics in general) may be helpful.

??? warning "Solution"
    Looking up at the ceiling, there is only one spot that matches the exact orientation of colored flames from the starting mural, toward the southern end of the room.
    ![[brightwyrm_solution.png]]
    Orient yourself directly beneath the center of these four "flames," as shown by the mural, and plunge into the lava. If positioned correctly, you will fall through to a pool of water.

Successfully solving the puzzle will result in the player finding themselves in a room below the main caldarium, and approaching the exit grants the victory message:

> Lai congratulates your bravery.

A chest will appear in this room, containing the [[Artifacts#Blaze-Blessed Breeches|Blaze-Blessed Breeches]] artifact and [[The Facets#Facet V|Facet V]]. The door behind will then open, revealing a long tunnel that leads back to the surface.
