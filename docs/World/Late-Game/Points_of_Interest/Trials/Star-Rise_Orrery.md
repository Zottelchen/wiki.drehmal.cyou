**Star-Rise Orrery** is the site of the [[Rihelma|Star-Rise Drake Rihelma]]'s [Trial](/World/Post-75_Area/Points_of_Interest/Trials/), accessed through a small cavern in the northern face of Aldregakar, the massive mountain in [[Rihelma's Domain]].

    On Lo'Dahr, these coordinates correspond to the entrance to the Orrery, just behind the waterfall.

## Rihelma's Trial
Upon reaching the Orrery, the following message plays in chat:

> Your eyes seem to sharpen and widen in equal measure as inscrutable darkness resolves into perfect panoramic clarity.

This is accompanied by the "Star-Rise Orrery" advancement.

The player is placed into Adventure Mode, and enters the Orrery proper through a door, beneath a sign that reads "SEEK SIX FLAWS".

The orrery itself is a massive, decadent room with intricate murals on its walls, a full depiction of the night sky, and a small particle-emanating platform in its center. The ground, made of ice, represents a reflection of the full room above it, although it may not appear a perfect reflection.

??? question "Light Hint: Mechanics"
    Walking into the central particles of the small platform will grant the player a Levitation V effect for 12 seconds, allowing them to drift upward to any point on the ceiling. This mechanic can be used to point out any discrepancies between the main room and its reflection. When a flaw is successfully identified, it will create a particle effect that travels to the door at the southern end of the room, turning a redstone lamp into a sea lantern.

??? warning "Solution"
    There are 6 flaws to be found between the room and its reflection below, both on the ceiling and the walls. The following is a list thereof, including X and Z coordinates.
    ??? danger "1: Corner Mural"
        The large circular mural on the northeastern corner wall is different in its reflection. Coordinates: **(1154, 985)**
    ??? danger "2: Wall Mural"
        In the west-southwest wing, a mural of purple glazed terracotta surrounded by netherite blocks is reflected as orange concrete surrounded by redstone blocks. Coordinates: **(1079, 1027)**
    ??? danger "3: White/Purple"
        Also in the WSW wing of the area, a five-block white cross on the ceiling is reflected below as a 9-block purple star/planetary body. Coordinates: **(1087, 1035)**
    ??? danger "4: Aphelion/Terminus"
        In the northwestern sky, a purple/white structure resembling the Terminus or Aphelion is visible on the ceiling, but is missing in the reflection. Coordinates: **(1110, 977)**
    ??? danger "5: Lapis Ring"
        Just southeast of the center, a blue and purple ring structure, with an outer ring of lapis lazuli blocks, is visible on the ceiling but missing in the reflection. Coordinates: **(1143, 1024)**
    ??? danger "6: High Diamond Reflection"
        Along the southeastern corner wall, there is a 5-block cross made of celestial debris and alloy (netherite) near the ceiling which is reflected light blue, as diamond blocks. Coordinates: **(1154, 1039)**

When the puzzle is successfully solved, the player will be given the following message:

> Rihelma congratulates your sharp eye.

The door at the southern end of the Orrery will then open, revealing a chest that contains the [[Artifacts#As Foretold|As Foretold]] artifact and [[The Facets#Facet II|Facet II]].
