**Greyspire Castle** is a large castle atop a grey stone mountain, in north-central [[Loe's Domain]]. The home of multiple unique items and very mysterious lore implications, the castle is one of the foremost points of interest on the divine moon.

Entering Greyspire Castle for the first time grants the "Greyspire Castle" advancement. This can be done through a long, winding path up the mountain from its southwestern base, with a blackstone gateway.

## Contents

Greyspire Castle is surrounded by, and filled with, yellow concrete and obsidian trees reminiscent of the flora in [[Khive's Domain]]. All of its inhabitants are [[Tehrmari]].

 From the entryway, there are two doors: one to the left and one to the right. 

The left door leads to servants' quarters and a boarded-up room, the latter of which contains the [[Dusty Notepad]] book.

Also in this wing is a large obsidian tree with a single grave, marked:

> MAY VOYNAHLA GUIDE THEE <br>
> Ravi Khi'nol <br>
> 0019 - 4231

These dates do not coincide with the standardized calendar on Drehmal, as no Avihm is denoted in the years. The fact that this [[Tehrmari]] lived for over 4000 years means that they must have been alive at some point in the First Avihm, as the entirety of recorded history post-[[Felling]] spans just shy of 3000 years. This name does not appear in text anywhere else in the map.

To the right from the entryway is the majority of the castle. Once back inside when following this path, the first door on the left leads to a library, with two books: the [[Stranded Thesis]] and [[The Founding Principles]]. Players can then follow the main hallway to a dining room and kitchen.

Up the stairs from this area is a set of bedrooms, culminating in the master bedroom at the end of the hallway. This room contains the [[Unpublished Thesis]] and [[Irtae's Journal]] books, as well as a door out to the balcony where the [[Artifacts#Luminous Diadem|Luminous Diadem]] artifact is located.

A set of stairs leads up inside this room, allowing access to the roof. From the roof, players can find a [[Fervor Stones#Stone of Worry|Stone of Worry]] in an enclosed room.

## Lore

The lore surrounding Greyspire Castle is extremely mysterious, and on its surface, possibly some of the most significant in the map.

It is unclear when the castle was first built, but its usage of flora from Khive's Domain and abundance of esoteric knowledge seems to suggest that its original inhabitants may have been disciples of [[Khive]], possibly transplanted onto the moon along with [[Ihted Academy]] in Av1. This may also be the reason why the two named inhabitants of the castle have last names beginning with "Khi", as some sort of signifier that they were disciples of Khive. 

The writings in Greyspire on the nature of the universe seem to be among the most accurate in the map, with the [[Stranded Thesis]] even being directly quoted by [[yellow|an immensely powerful being]] in the end-game. Missing pages from [[The Founding Principles]] seem to suggest that the knowledge in that book was very close to reality, and had to be destroyed by a higher power, as seen in the [[Fall of Avsohm]].

During the [[Divine Schism]], Greyspire Castle was the headquarters of the Anti-Palaesidan faction. Since the Schism, they have been an extremely mysterious force in Loe's Domain, with the nearby residents of [[Loeturia]] knowing extremely little about its current rulers beyond whispered rumors.

[[Irtae's Journal]] writes about another current resident of the castle, an [[arcanism|arcanist]] named Hanu. Irtae describes him as the most powerful arcanist on Lo'Dahr, but notes that he has been late to return home from [[Naharja]] by two days. He may have disappeared during this time, possibly removed by a higher being for attempting to continue the work of the castle's previous inhabitants.

## Extras

### Trivia

Greyspire Castle was originally a survival base built by Drehmal co-creator Keeko100, repurposed into a structure for the map. 

***

The [[Artifacts#Copporius' Scepter|Copporius' Scepter]] artifact is located inside the Greyspire mountain, several dozen blocks below the castle with no way to reach it without digging. This is an easter egg and/or inside joke item.
