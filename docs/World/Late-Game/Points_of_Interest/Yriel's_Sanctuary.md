**Yriel's Sanctuary** (also called **Yriel's Tomb**) is a small habitable area in the southeastern [[Lunar Wastes]], only normally accessible by completing the [six trials](/World/Post-75_Area/Points_of_Interest/Trials/) found on the divine moon.

Upon completion of all six trials, a portal will appear in [[Ytaj]], in the room below the Prismatic Council Chamber. This portal takes the player to Yriel's Sanctuary, where they can find [[Syzygy]] and the [[The Facets#Facet VII|final Facet]].

Arriving to the island the proper way grants the "Some Hope for the Future?" advancement.

## Layout

The layout of Yriel's Sanctuary is very simple. Upon teleporting to the island, players will arrive in a small gazebo, with a prismarine path extending out to a bridge. This bridge leads to a tall, gold-lined structure, seemingly the actual tomb of [[Yriel]] themselves.

Here, [[Syzygy]] rests on top of the tomb, while Facet VII sits behind the tomb beneath signs that memorialize the area's namesake. These signs read:

> HERE LIES YRIEL REZHAD <br>
> MOONSWORN <br>
> 
> Though their life was short, their devotion was unmatched.
> 
> Friend of the Aspects and of many others here and on Drehmal.
>
> Their service and their legacy shall not be forgotten. <br>
> <>-<=o=>-<>

## Extras

### Trivia

Yriel's Sanctuary is the same biome as [[Ytaj]]: Old Growth Spruce Taiga.

***

The dimensions of the lake surrounding Yriel's Sanctuary are a rough match for the dimensions of the Sunken Astral Body in [[Akhlo'Rohma]], a fallen fragment of Lo'Dahr (Yriel's Sanctuary crater is about 420 blocks long and 350 blocks wide, the SAB is about 360 blocks long and 280 blocks wide). They do not share exact dimensions, but they do have a similar elliptical shape. Furthermore, the glass jellyfish seen on the Sunken Astral Body are also found around the edges of the sanctuary, and nowhere else in the Lunar Wastes. This makes it very plausible that the Sunken Astral Body is a chunk of the Wastes, which was removed from Lo'Dahr and transplanted onto the [[disc]].

***  

It is technically possible to make it to Yriel's Sanctuary without finishing the trials, either by brute force or by circumventing the Lunar Wastes' damage system. The brute force method involves stacking massive amounts of totems of undying, simply reviving every few seconds when the cosmic rays would otherwise kill you. The other method involves flying over the world height limit, as Lunar Wastes damage is applied when a player is in the Lunar Wastes biome. Since biomes only go to world height, players above this y-level are not damaged. However, since this area cannot be built in, this is only possible in survival mode by techniques such as [[Artifacts#Sharksbane|Sharksbane]] bowboosting.
