**Arkeje** (pronounced "are-kee-ye") is an abandoned town along the border of [[Dahr's Domain]] and [[Voynahla's Domain]], and formerly the center of a larger Republic of Arkeje. It was heavily influenced by the culture of both Aspects' domains. The [[Will of Kanama]] and [[The Augury]] books are found here.

## Layout

Arkeje is built on a hilltop in the east of Dahr's Domain, overlooking parts of Voynahla's Domain. About 16 houses made out of acacia wood, exposed copper, cobblestone and dark prismarine make up this abandoned town. To the east, a walkway extends a few meters off the cliff, seemingly for the death-worshipping residents to walk off of in ritual sacrifices. At the bottom of this drop lies the [[Artifacts#Burial Legwear|Burial Legwear]] artifact.

The two books inside of the town are in separate houses towards the southern end.

While the architecture of the town is similar to other places in Dahr's Domain, it is filled with red and black banners representative of Voynahla.

## Lore

The Republic of Arkeje, centered in this town, was a center of [[Tehrmari#Ro'Tehrmari|Ro'Tehrmari]] power alongside [[Rohei]] in its prime, as the mortal Tehrmari were drawn to worship of the Aspect of Death. While it was situated within Dahr's Domain, it seems to have drawn more culturally from [[Voynahla]] worship. The [[Will of Kanama]] book in the town tells of the author's decision to end their own life in honor of Voynahla, hoping that their soul does not end up oppressed in the next lifetime. It is possible that the entire town went this route somewhat recently, as the town is almost completely intact but totally abandoned.

The Republic of Arkeje was led by the Speaker of Arkeje, and from [[The Augury]], we see that the last Speaker was a Tehrmari named Malka Gorrhys. She was an incredibly accomplished leader venerated by Ro'Tehrmari throughout the moon. While it is not entirely clear, that book appears to show its POV character witnessing Malka's death at the hands of [[Sereven]], leader of the Talon, possibly depicting the start of Sereven's Coup.
