**Rihanar** (pronounced "ree-hah-nar") is a floating, ruined city, spanning between the northern and central thirds of [[Rihelma's Domain]]. Referred to as once being among the largest cities on the moon, it stands abandoned today, holding only the [[Artifacts#Phoenixfeather Cloak|Phoenixfeather Cloak]].

## Layout

Rihanar is mostly contained to a single large floating island, which must be reached by some combination of gliding, towering, and climbing, like the other POI in this part of Rihelma's Domain.

The only notable piece of loot is found in the floor of the domed building at the town's northern end: the [[Artifacts#Phoenixfeather Cloak|Phoenixfeather Cloak]] artifact.

## Lore

Little is known about Rihanar. The artifact found there reads:

> Rihanar, the third-largest Tehrmari habitation prior to the Schism, remained an isolated hub for craftspeople until every soul within disappeared one day. This thermal outerwear is perfect for travel in cold, windy regions.

The other known fact about Rihanar is that it was the birthplace and hometown of [[Oriann]], the legendary commander and owner of [[Aeongale]] who was once extremely close to [[Rihelma]] herself.
