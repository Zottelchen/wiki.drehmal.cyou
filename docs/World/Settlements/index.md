# Settlements

Scattered throughout the map of Drehmal are many different settlements. These settlements vary greatly in size, from populations of less than 10 to over 500 inhabitants. Settlements can be categorized into "official" towns, which always have an [[Adventuring Merchant]] (and appear on the map sold by them, other than New Sahd and Naharja), a special advancement for discovering them under the "Civilization" category, and an inn of some sorts. There are also many "unofficial" villages that are usually smaller on the map.
