# Official Towns

> The map of [[Overworld|Drehmal]] sold by every [[Adventuring Merchant]], with the 14 official towns represented by colored dots.


Official Towns are the largest and most important settlements in Drehmal. 

Specifically, they are the settlements which give special [[advancements]] under the "Discovery" tab when found, have their own custom soundtrack, and are home to merchants including an [[Adventuring Merchant]], a [[Runic Blacksmith]], and other specialized traders. No regions have more than one, and some regions do not have an official town at all, as there are only 14 on Drehmal.

All official towns have a single in-game map placed in item frames, which shows a layout of the town with banners marking points of interest. These maps also always have a crafting table and a Primal Cache at their sides. 

Official towns will also almost always have some kind of inn building, with one special room containing a Primal Cache.

Almost all official towns have roads (in varying degrees of disrepair) leading to them.
