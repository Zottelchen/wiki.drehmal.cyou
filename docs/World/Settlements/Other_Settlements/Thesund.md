Thesund is largely unremarkable besides its [[Runic Blacksmith]], who sells [[Artisan Items#Thesund|two artisan items]], both horse armor.

## Lore

Thesund is within New Drabyel's sphere of influence, (likely to be under the same government) as noted by the same banners within the settlement. This is likely the United Townships of Dreh'Noha.

Based on the [[Official Records 1|book]] found here, the village was founded by teenage survivors of the [[Fall of Avsohm]], whose parents were killed in the empire's collapse. These people may have initially lived in Av'Sal and ventured north after it was reduced to ruin, and they have established a very simple, sustainable way of life.
