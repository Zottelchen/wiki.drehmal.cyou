There is a side storyline tied to Helmshire.

## Layout

Helmshire is made of a variety of materials, primarily using spruce wood from the surrounding woods. Some buildings also utilize bricks, blackstone, white terracotta, and moss.

The town's [[Runic Blacksmith]] sells [[Artisan Items#Helmshire|two artisan items]], located at the western edge of the village.

## Lore

Helmshire's story is mostly told by the [[Old Villager's Journal]] book, found in one of the houses. As a rural part of the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]], the town was mostly abandoned by [[Mossfield]] following the Order's collapse and the departure of [[Virtuo]]. When people began to go missing and Mossfield refused to send help, the villagers were forced to send their own people out on search and rescue missions, and enforce a strict curfew at night. Neighbors grew suspicious of one another, rising to a crucial point of tension. At this time, an old villager named Elkhorn Myriksson returned and told the others that he had discovered a "magical sanctuary" in the woods away from Helmshire, and proposed that they simply leave. Some of the villagers did just that, leading to the small remnants of the village today, while the curfew has managed to keep further disappearances from occurring.

Information from other nearby sources suggests that the disappearances were abductions by the Skeveraan alchemist living in the nearby [[Skeveraan Laboratory]].
