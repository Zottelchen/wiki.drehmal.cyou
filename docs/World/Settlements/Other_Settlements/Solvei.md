## Lore

This small village appears to have recently suffered a fire, with some of the houses being burnt down.

It is also within New [[Drabyel]]'s sphere of influence, (likely to be under the same government) as noted by the same banners across the settlement. This may be the modern version of the United Townships of Dreh'Noha.
