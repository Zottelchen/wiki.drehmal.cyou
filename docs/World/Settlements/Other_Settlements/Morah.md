    Approximate Coordinates: `4477, 141, 5602`

The town is home to a [[Runic Blacksmith]] who sells [[Artisan Items#Morah|one artisan item]], the "Sunrise Seekers". It also holds a building which is presumed to be the home of the Aspect of Drehmari, [[Mari]].

## Layout

Morah is situated in the white mountains of northern Sahd, built along a natural switchback and contained by a dark wooden wall. Its buildings are typical of the Sahdan style, with signature pink trees and flowers found throughout the town, as well as fields of wheat. 

One larger house disconnected from the rest is found to the north, and is believed to be the home of Mari. It holds the [[Artifacts#Casain Theater Mask|Casain Theater Mask]] artifact.

The Runic Blacksmith is located near the western entrance.

A separate tower to the east might be loosely considered an extension of Morah, if anything, and it contains three books relating to "The Path", the dominant Sahdan religion.

## Lore

The lore surrounding Morah is not particularly clear, but it is possible due to its location that it was born out of a previous town built by the [[Moen]]-worshipping Dahe clan. It seems to have been the home of Mari while he lived on Sahd, and it might even still be where he resides, at times.
