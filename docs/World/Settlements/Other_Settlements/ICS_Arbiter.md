The **I.C.S. Arbiter** (likely standing for Insohmic Coalition Ship) is an airship located just off the northeastern coast of [[Merijool]]. Along with [[Mossfield]], it is the only surviving remnant of the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]] in modern Drehmal. The [[Whispersong]] legendary bow is found here.

The Arbiter is found floating over the water east of [[Mt. Mekta]], stationary due to the limitations of the Minecraft map. It is home to over 40 villagers.

## Contents

As the Arbiter is suspended in the air, it must be glided or bridged to.

On the upper deck, at the bow of the ship, a room sits behind an iron door. Inside of this room, at the very front of the ship, is a chest containing the [[Whispersong]] legendary.

Heading downstairs on the east side of the ship, players will immediately encounter the area's [[Runic Blacksmith]], who sells [[Artisan Items#ICS Arbiter|one unique artisan item]]. This level also contains a large Insohmic council chamber to the north, and the ship's control room to the south.

Another floor down, players may find barracks, stored missiles and an anchor, and a bedroom containing the [[Old Memories]] book.

## Lore

The I.C.S. Arbiter was the flagship of the Insohmic military, constructed with scavenged [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] technology. In the [[Battle for Drehmal]], the Arbiter was used as a mobile center of government for Insohm's Grand Council, an effective mobile base that helped to win them the war.

The book [[Old Memories]] recounts a wartime meeting on the Arbiter in which [[Vahid]] spoke up and won over the council, becoming the new Master of Insohm in the process.

Today, the Arbiter is one of two places where Insohm still truly rules, alongside [[Mossfield|New Mossfield]].
