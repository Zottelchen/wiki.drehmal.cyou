The village is home to a [[Runic Blacksmith]] and two lore books.

## Layout

Hevhlak is made of distinctively white and light-colored buildings, which are made of quartz and smooth stone walls with birch wood roofs. The village has gates to its north and south making it accessible by land, with a lightly weathered trail leading from the southern gate towards the region's tower and a small dock. A dock sits at the western edge of the town, connecting the town to one of the region's larger rivers, which flows into the [[Gulf of Drehmal]].

The Tehrmari Runic Blacksmith is located next to the dock, in a house marked by the signature blue wool awning. This blacksmith sells [[Artisan Items#Hevhlak|two artisan items]].

## Lore

The people of Hevhlak are Ro'Tehrmari, a part of the lower class of [[Tehrmari]]. They are the only Ro'Tehrmari known to live on Drehmal in the modern day, as the only other Tehrmari are La'Tehrmari members of the Wingmakers and Scalebound, in the monastery nearby. The [[Uninvited Guests]] book found here tells the story of the residents being visited by three members of the Wingmakers, and warned about the danger of [[Tethlaen]].

The other book in this village is [[Three Great Sigils]], which establishes that the inhabitants of Hevhlak seem to worship [[Dahroehl]], the Aspect of Freshwater.
