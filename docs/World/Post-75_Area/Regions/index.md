> A map outlining the main regions of Lo'Dahr.

This section contains pages on the Aspect Domains of [[Lo'Dahr]], analogous to the [Regions](/World/Drehmal/Regions/) of Drehmal.

There are a total of 15 regions on the divine moon: 14 extremely distinct, fantastical regions owned and shaped by one of the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/), which are simply named after their patron Aspect, and the great city of [[Ytaj]], a colossal temple complex known as the "sacred place of all divinity," which itself serves as the 15th region.

Each of these regions is composed entirely of one Minecraft biome, which is denoted on its individual region page.
