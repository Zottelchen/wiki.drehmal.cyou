**Palaesida's Domain** is one of 14 Aspect Domains on [[Lo'Dahr]], belonging to the deceased Aspect of Storms, Tempest [[Palaesida]]. This region was once a sea, but since its patron's death, has dried and blackened, eventually being consumed by an eternal storm after his bones arose from their resting place[^1]. The region sits just southeast of the geographic center of Lo'Dahr's habitable area, bordering [[Dahr's Domain]] to the west, [[Nahyn's Domain]] to the north, [[Rihelma's Domain]] to the east, and [[Voynahla's Domain]] to the south.

[^1]: While Palaesida's Domain is intended to be consumed by this eternal storm, this is not well represented due to Minecraft's technical constraints, as all of the terrain is static in-game.
