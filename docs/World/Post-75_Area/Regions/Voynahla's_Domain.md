**Voynahla's Domain** is one of 14 Aspect Domains on [[Lo'Dahr]], belonging to the partially-deceased Aspect of Death, Soul-Stealer [[Voynahla]]. This region is dark and hostile, littered with gravestones of Voynahla's followers and centered around a blood-red river. The region sits in the south-southeast portion of Lo'Dahr's habitable area, between [[Dahr's Domain]] in the west, [[Palaesida's Domain]] in the north, and [[Rihelma's Domain]] in the east.
