**Moen's Domain** is one of 14 Aspect Domains on [[Lo'Dahr]], belonging to the Aspect of Pleasure, Kind Wyrm [[Moen]]. This region is where the player will first touch down on Lo'Dahr after the [[Aphelion]] sequence, and is home to the city of [[Naharja]]. It takes the form of a light green meadow, with modest freshwater and colorful trees. The region sits in the north-central portion of Lo'Dahr's habitable area, bordering [[Vayniklah's Domain]] to the west, [[Maen's Domain]] to the southwest, [[Nahyn's Domain]] to the south, and [[Taihgel's Domain]] to the east. A path leading due north from the region's main lake takes the player to the sacred halls of [[Ytaj]].
