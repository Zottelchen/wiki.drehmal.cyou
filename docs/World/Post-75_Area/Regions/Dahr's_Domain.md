**Dahr's Domain** is one of 14 Aspect Domains on [[Lo'Dahr]], belonging to the Elder Sea Aspect and king of the entire moon, [[Dahr]]. As one might expect, the region is primarily made up of water, including a swamp sub-region, a large river, and a series of waterfalls into the moon's largest lake. This domain is found in the southern and southwestern portion of Lo'Dahr's habitable area, forming a buffer between [[Loe's Domain]] in the far southwest and the rest of the moon.
