## Description { data-search-exclude }

![[vay_domain.png]]

**Vayniklah's Domain** is one of 14 Aspect Domains on [[Lo'Dahr]], belonging to Life-Bringer [[Vayniklah]], Aspect of Life. The region is a vast jungle with a single large river running through it, and is heavily themed after bees. The region sits in the north-northwest portion of Lo'Dahr's habitable area, sandwiched between [[Khive's Domain]] in the west and a combination of [[Ytaj]], [[Moen's Domain]], and [[Maen's Domain]] in the east, in addition to sharing a border with [[Dahr's Domain]] in the south.

## Geography

Vayniklah's Domain is primarily made up of a dense jungle, surrounding a singular large river that runs between Ytaj in the north and Dahr's Domain in the south, with a large protrusion jutting into Khive's Domain to the west. This western protrusion contains a tributary, which is fed by water from Khive's Domain and feeds into the main river. The river culminates in a massive waterfall in the south, opening up to a large lake containing the [[Temple of Life]], and continues southwest to feed the swamp sub-region of Dahr's Domain.

The region is somewhat hilly in the east, along its border with Moen's Domain, and in the north, where it meets the [[Lunar Wastes]].

The canopy is primarily made up of tall custom trees made out of oak wood and styled to look like jungle trees, with sparse leaves mostly near the top. Smaller custom azalea/honeycomb trees, as well as large honeycomb-themed mushrooms, can also be found throughout the region, in addition to some of the pink wool trees from Moen's Domain in the east.

## Gameplay

Vayniklah's Domain is full of passive bees and can be a very scenic location, but it is also home to some of the most dangerous custom mobs in the game.

## History

This region's primary settlement is the Lifegiven Hospital, located in the northeast along the riverbank. This [[Tehrmari]] hospital contains [[Lifegiven Ertri's Journal|a book]] which provides insight into the relationship between [[Avsohm]] and the people of Lo'Dahr. This book describes the Sanguine Corrode, a [[Drehmari]] disease that was brought to Lo'Dahr by Avsohm in late Av2, and which ravaged the local population even years after the [[Fall of Avsohm|empire's disappearance]]. 

## Points of Interest

### Gateway Cavern

A cavern in the northeast is linked to one of the mysterious gateway structures found elsewhere throughout the map, although this one's mechanic is somewhat unique.

??? warning "Gate Info"
    This gateway is one of 6 portals between [[Overworld|Drehmal]] and [[Lo'Dahr]], and this one in particular is linked to the stump-like portal in western [[Spearhead Forest]]. This is the only one of the portals which does not contain a proper gateway structure, but rather, is directly fallen through. Jumping into the portal on the Spearhead Forest side will result in the player falling out into the cavern in Vayniklah's Domain, and the portal on this side must be flown up to or reached with an Ender Pearl.

### Lifegiven Hospital

On the eastern bank of the river that runs through this region, a large complex built into the side of a mountain serves as a [[Tehrmari]] hospital.

### Temple of Life

The Temple of Life is a temple located on an island in the southern lake of Vayniklah's Domain, at the bottom of the region's wide waterfall. It is the site of Vayniklah's [Trial](/World/Post-75_Area/Points_of_Interest/Trials/). The [[Eldermead]] legendary is found here.
