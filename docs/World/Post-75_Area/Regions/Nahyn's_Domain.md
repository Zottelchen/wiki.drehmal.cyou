## Description { data-search-exclude }

![[nahyn_domain.png]]

**Nahyn's Domain** is one of 14 Aspect Domains on [[Lo'Dahr]], belonging to Summit-Drake [[Nahyn]], the Aspect of Mountains. This region comprises multiple sub-regions, including three snow-capped peaks, coniferous forest, and a small open meadow. The region sits near the geographic center of Lo'Dahr's habitable area, slightly to the east of the midline, and bordering several other regions.

## Geography

Nahyn's Domain features diverse terrain, including three distinct environmental sub-regions:

- Three snowy mountains and a bowl between them, making up most of the region's area. <br>
- Three discrete patches of coniferous forest: One along the northern border with Moen's Domain, one in the east, and one in the west. <br>
- A southern meadow, filled with white, orange, and yellow flowers.

Three frozen lakes can be found in the mountainous portion of Nahyn's Domain, and several small streams run off from this central glacier to the south, feeding into what was once a massive sea in [[Palaesida's Domain]]. A lake found in the meadow portion of this region also feeds into the large lake in [[Dahr's Domain]].

## Gameplay

Goats and Green Pseudodragons naturally spawn in the mountaintops of Nahyn's Domain.

Two custom enemies can also be found here.

**Dire Bears** are variants of polar bears who aggro more easily, deal more damage, and appear brown like grizzly bears.

| **Description** | **Tremorliths** are custom magma cubes, re-textured to appear like deepslate. Tremorliths can spawn either as full-size (size 4) magma cubes, or as small magma cubes, with the "**Tremorlittle**" name. Tremorliths are well-armored, and cause small explosions when they jump and land. Tremorliths are, however, uniquely vulnerable to pickaxes, being made of stone. Tremorliths drop one piece of deepslate on death.  |
| **Notes** |  The "A Gentle Slaughter" advancement can be obtained by killing a Tremorlith using a Silk Touch-enchanted pickaxe. |

## History

The known history of Nahyn's Domain is mostly tied to the history of the Free Lands of Rohei (later the [[Roheian Empire]]). After the original founders of Rohei were exiled from [[Naharja]] in the bordering [[Moen's Domain]], they appear to have settled in the northern and western portions of Nahyn's Domain, particularly at [[Fort Aelon]]. Rohei became a powerful player in [[Tehrmari]] politics on the moon, but it ultimately collapsed prior to the modern day.

## Points of Interest

### Corrupted Crystal Cavern

The northeastern of the three mountains in Nahyn's Domain is hollow, and inside the mountain, a strange cavern can be found. This cavern features a large blackstone structure in its center, with a pile of amethyst blocks. A spawner block here produces custom zombies named "Corrupted Crystal," who have an amethyst block for a head, and can drop amethyst blocks on death. This area can be accessed through a cavern to the east, beginning in [[Noha's Domain]], or it can be dug into from the lava in the mountain above.
