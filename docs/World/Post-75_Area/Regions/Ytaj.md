## Description { data-search-exclude }

![[ytaj.png]]

**Ytaj** (pronounced yih-tie or yee-tie) is the 15th region of [[Lo'Dahr]]. Distinct from the other regions, which are the domains of one of the many [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/), Ytaj is a massive palace complex, which is heralded as the sacred meeting place of all the gods of the realm of Drehmal. This area is the most intricate build in the map of Drehmal, containing a vast array of grandiose white buildings, meeting halls, shrines, and living quarters of the gods themselves. It is located in the far north of Lo'Dahr's habitable area, extending out beyond the moon's otherwise roughly square boundaries.

Ytaj borders [[Vayniklah's Domain]] to the west, [[Moen's Domain]] to the south, [[Taihgel's Domain]] to the southeast, and [[Lahrs' Domain]] to the east. It is primarily accessed through a massive bridge that extends due north from Moen's Domain.

## Geography

The city/palace portion of Ytaj, or Ytaj proper, is circular, but the overall region takes on more of an upside-down pear shape, owing to the massive bridge that extends south between Ytaj proper and Moen's Domain. The palace is surrounded by a larger ring of gardens and statues, themselves enclosed by a larger wall. The entire landform is surrounded by a moat, fed from the west by the river in Vayniklah's Domain. 

The primary point of access is a massive white and purple bridge which runs north/south from the palace to Moen's Domain, stretching for over 500 blocks. A lake is found underneath one portion of this bridge, contained entirely within the island.

### Design

Ytaj's aesthetic pulls on heavy use of white, purple, and blue, with all buildings in the area made primarily out of some combination of quartz, calcite, diorite, amethyst, and infused amethyst.

Individual rooms in Ytaj heavily reference color schemes related to specific Aspects or Deities, as most of the rooms in Ytaj are dedicated to one specific god. The colors of the four Elders—yellow for [[Khive]], blue for [[Dahr]], red for [[Taihgel]], and purple for [[Rihelma]]—are very prominently featured, both in the design of banners and symbols around the area and in items tied to Ytaj.

## Gameplay

There are no enemies that naturally spawn in Ytaj.

There are, however, many unique gameplay elements in this area.

### Traders

#### Precocious Kinah

![[kinah.png]]

**Precocious Kinah** is an ascended cat, who serves as a protector of the palace and a merchant to the player. She is located at the very front of Ytaj's main eastern hallway, sitting upon a small pillar. Kinah sells multiple [[Trinkets]], and deals primarily in **Divine Baubles**, a kind of custom currency that is found only in Ytaj. Divine Baubles can be found as loot throughout the palace complex, and can also be purchased (for a relatively high price) from Kinah. A full list of all 111 known Divine Bauble locations is found below Kinah's trades, organized roughly by geographic location, starting in the southwest and working clockwise.

#### Benefactor Zabuyah

**Benefactor Zabuyah** is a [[Tehrmari]] trader found in the main eastern hall of Ytaj, in a room just behind Precocious Kinah and to the right. Zabuyah sells books (the merchant directly sells trapped chests, but each chest simply contains a book of the same name), which serve as hints toward the locations of [[Devotion]] shrines on the [[Overworld]]. There are 11 of these books, with alliterative titles that tell the player a hint as to the general area of each shrine. Each book costs 12 Amethyst Shards.

**Coordinates:** (-5, 29, -1562)

#### Runic Blacksmith

A Runic Blacksmith is found in southeastern Ytaj, in a small yard behind Rihelma's room. This Runic Blacksmith sells [[Artisan Items#Ytaj|three artisan items]], all themed after the La'Tehrmari subdivisions—the Talon, Wingmakers, and Scalebound priests.

**Coordinates:** (35, 29, -1535)

### Secondary Devotion Shrines

Each of the 11 Deities and Aspects who have a [[Devotion]] shrine (the three [Deities](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Deities/) and eight [Major Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/Major_Aspects/)) has a secondary shrine somewhere in Ytaj, where they can be given offerings just like their primary shrine on [[Overworld|Drehmal]]. Devotion progress is global, so if you have already maxed out your devotion to a certain Aspect, giving additional offerings at Ytaj will not do anything. Conversely, if you are unable to find a shrine on Drehmal, you can use the Ytaj one instead.

For coordinates of secondary Devotion shrines, see the corresponding Deity or Aspect's "Room" section in the Points of Interest portion of this article.

### Dialogue Interactions

There are two entirely optional, but extensive dialogue interactions to be found in Ytaj, both in one of the tallest towers in the northern side of the palace.

#### Tower of Drehmal

The Tower of Drehmal is the tallest tower in Ytaj, located at the northern end of the region and accessed at the ground level either through one of the side wings or directly from the Prismatic Council Chamber. The Soletta is located in the base of this tower, and behind the Soletta, one will find a small gate which reads "Tower of Drehmal, Begin Ascent^". Beginning the climb up this tower will initiate a dialogue sequence, known officially as "Dreams of the Serpent", or simply the "Dream Dialogue".

![[dream_dia_intro.png]]
> The first two lines of the Dream Dialogue.

The Dream Dialogue is presented differently from the rest of the text in Drehmal, with an alternating combination of text cues in the chat and lines spoken directly by Drehmal at the top of the screen. This sequence lasts for approximately 9-10 minutes, and will pause if the player leaves the bounds of the tower, later resuming if that player returns to the tower. The dream only occurs once per player normally, but it can be viewed again by using the `/function players:misc/dream_dia/reset` command.

??? question "Dream Dialogue Content"
    The Dream Dialogue appears to depict the player actively partaking in [[Drehmal]]'s dream, while being simultaneously addressed by the Realmbinder, who gives a verbose monologue about their ancestry and the fundamental nature of entropy and change. The text cues in chat indicate that the player begins to feel as if they are Drehmal, born of the [[Primal Tree]] and immensely powerful, before snapping back to reality as Drehmal consciously shifts the direction of their dream. They end the sequence by dreaming about their hypothetical awakening, returning to live among the people they created, finding fulfillment in their company once again until the inevitable end.

    A full transcript of this sequence can be found [[Dreams of the Serpent|here]].

![[tower_of_drehmal_interior.png]]

The full dialogue sequence can be seen without fully climbing the tower, but climbing to the top will bring the player to Drehmal's secondary shrine. The ascent requires players to perform some slightly difficult traversal—jumping between platforms, swimming up waterfalls, and climbing some vines. About 2/3 of the way up, players will come to a solid platform, which branches off to the other two tallest towers in Ytaj, southwest and southeast of this tower, respectively. An empty shaft to the north can be dropped down safely, bringing players to a hidden chamber right next to the beginning of the climb, with a block that can be broken to create a shortcut. This shaft serves as an elevator, allowing easy return up to the platform without having to navigate the entirety of the terrain again. Drehmal's shrine at the top is accessed by touching the particles on the area's floating islands, which give the player 4 seconds of Levitation II.

#### Tower of Maelihs

From the elevator platform at the Tower of Drehmal, two carpeted paths lead out to other towers, with a red one leading to the southwest and a blue one to the southeast. Predictably, these two paths lead to towers dedicated to [[Maelihs]] and [[Virtuo]] respectively, the two other Deities. Virtuo's tower to the southeast contains her private chambers in Ytaj, including [[Artifacts#Fortitude|her shield]] and a [[Closed Diary|lore book]] written by the Goddess herself that explains her current whereabouts. Mael's tower, to the southwest, however, contains something even more interesting: the Burnt Lord himself.

![[mael_ytaj.png]]
> Maelihs, sitting in his throne in Ytaj.

In the western tower—Maelihs' tower—Mael himself is found sitting in his throne, idly lounging and occasionally tossing a knife into the air. He speaks to the player through the in-game chat, and has a full dialogue tree, which has a complete transcription [[Mael Dialogue|here]]. Special dialogue lines can be heard if the player first meets Mael with full [[devotion]] to him, or if they approach him at any time while holding [[Malevolentia]].

## History

It is unknown exactly how old Ytaj is, but it does appear to have served as the center for the Aspects' affairs on Lo'Dahr since at least the mid-Second Avihm. Ytaj likely originated no earlier than early Av2, as it prominently features towers specifically dedicated to the Deities, who did not exist in Av1. Ytaj could have plausibly been built as a direct result of the Aspects largely withdrawing from [[Drehmari]] affairs on [[Overworld|Drehmal]], as they seem to have had a minimal presence on the [[disc]] since at least mid-late Av2, and would have needed a new home.

Ytaj was a central location in the events of the [[Divine Schism]], which saw the Aspects split into two warring factions, the Palaesidans and Anti-Palaesidans, named for Palaesida, the Aspect of Storms, whose actions arguably set the entire Schism in motion, and whose death brought about its end. Ytaj saw at least two battles (implied by the fact that two artifacts reference a "First" Battle of Ytaj) during the Divine Schism, and appears to have been under control of both sides at different points in the war.

After the Schism, which resulted in the deaths of [[Noha]], [[Palaesida]], and (indirectly) [[Voynahla]], the Aspects mostly became reclusive, fearing that they too could lose their lives if they dared to show their physical forms. As a result, astral projection to Ytaj became the primary means of communication between the Aspects, and today, as we learn from Mael, only a few Aspects—including [[Dahr]], [[Khive]], [[Nahyn]], and [[Dahroehl]]—still visit physically on a regular basis.

At some point, [[Yriel]], the servant of the Aspects, was sent into Ytaj to murder a large faction of the Talon, effectively the La'Tehrmari police/guard force. The Talon had become a corrupt, incredibly oppressive force on Lo'Dahr, particularly prejudiced against the Ro'Tehrmari, and the Aspects, while unable to interfere directly, decided to act against them. Yriel, using their [[Syzygy|signature weapon]], single-handedly slayed the majority of the Talon in Ytaj, greatly breaking the faction's grasp on the moon.

The Prismatic Council appears to be the official name for a gathering of all the Aspects and Deities, with their meetings taking place in the grandiose Prismatic Council chamber near the center of Ytaj. Several important meetings are known to have occurred here, particularly towards the end of the Third Avihm, when [[Khive]] summoned Mael and Virtuo to Ytaj in order to fully explain their origins, as well as Virtuo's final interaction with the Aspects before departing for [[Eastern Xivrhynt]].

Today, Ytaj appears much less densely inhabited than it was at its peak, with only a handful of Tehrmari servants, Maelihs, and Precocious Kinah currently living in the palace.

### Aspect/Deity Rooms

In Ytaj, almost every single Aspect and Deity has their own room. For Major Aspects, these rooms include secondary devotion shrines, and the three Deities each have a full tower dedicated to them.

It is possible that not all Aspects have a room, and some rooms are disputed within the community, but this wiki provides a nearly complete list of Aspect rooms/shrines. Notable exceptions include:

- [[Verrhys]] - Who may have some minor references, but should not be expected to have a room, given that they are not remembered by any of the other Aspects. <br>
- [[Tethlaen]] - Who might have one reference, but does not appear to have a proper room. This may also be due to the fact he disappeared at the very beginning of Av2, and Ytaj was likely built after his disappearance. <br>
- [[Noha]] - Despite being a prominent Aspect, Noha does not appear to have any dedicated room in Ytaj. <br>
- [[Moen]] - Disputed. One room could plausibly belong to Moen by process of elimination, but the only spot that clearly invokes her imagery is a small outdoor space.

This list is presented in approximate geographic order, starting from Dahr's area in the southwest and circling clockwise back around to Palaesida's Room in the southeast.
