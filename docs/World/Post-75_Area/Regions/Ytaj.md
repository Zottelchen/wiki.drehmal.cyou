## Description { data-search-exclude }

![[ytaj.png]]

**Ytaj** (pronounced yih-tie or yee-tie) is the 15th region of [[Lo'Dahr]]. Distinct from the other regions, which are the domains of one of the many [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/), Ytaj is a massive palace complex, which is heralded as the sacred meeting place of all the gods of the realm of Drehmal. This area is the most intricate build in the map of Drehmal, containing a vast array of grandiose white buildings, meeting halls, shrines, and living quarters of the gods themselves. It is located in the far north of Lo'Dahr's habitable area, extending out beyond the moon's otherwise roughly square boundaries.

Ytaj borders [[Vayniklah's Domain]] to the west, [[Moen's Domain]] to the south, [[Taihgel's Domain]] to the southeast, and [[Lahrs' Domain]] to the east. It is primarily accessed through a massive bridge that extends due north from Moen's Domain.

## Geography

The city/palace portion of Ytaj, or Ytaj proper, is circular, but the overall region takes on more of an upside-down pear shape, owing to the massive bridge that extends south between Ytaj proper and Moen's Domain. The palace is surrounded by a larger ring of gardens and statues, themselves enclosed by a larger wall. The entire landform is surrounded by a moat, fed from the west by the river in Vayniklah's Domain. 

The primary point of access is a massive white and purple bridge which runs north/south from the palace to Moen's Domain, stretching for over 500 blocks. A lake is found underneath one portion of this bridge, contained entirely within the island.

Ytaj's aesthetic pulls on heavy use of white, purple, and blue, with all buildings in the area made primarily out of some combination of quartz, calcite, diorite, amethyst, and infused amethyst.

## Gameplay

There are no enemies that naturally spawn in Ytaj.

There are, however, many unique gameplay elements in this area.

### Traders

#### Precocious Kinah

![[kinah.png]]

**Precocious Kinah** is an ascended cat, who serves as a protector of the palace and a merchant to the player. She is located at the very front of Ytaj's main eastern hallway, sitting upon a small pillar. Kinah sells multiple [[Trinkets]], and deals primarily in **Divine Baubles**, a kind of custom currency that is found only in Ytaj. Divine Baubles can be found as loot throughout the palace complex, and can also be purchased (for a relatively high price) from Kinah. A full list of all 111 known Divine Bauble locations is found below Kinah's trades.

#### Benefactor Zabuyah

**Benefactor Zabuyah** is a [[Tehrmari]] trader found in the main eastern hall of Ytaj, in a room just behind Precocious Kinah and to the right. Zabuyah sells books (the merchant directly sells trapped chests, but each chest simply contains a book of the same name), which serve as hints toward the locations of [[Devotion]] shrines on the [[Overworld]]. There are 11 of these books, with alliterative titles that tell the player a hint as to the general area of each shrine. Each book costs 12 Amethyst Shards.

**Coordinates:** (-5, 29, -1562)

Full transcripts of the 11 respective books can be found at their pages:
