**Ytaj** (pronounced yih-tie or yee-tie) is the 15th region of [[Lo'Dahr]]. Distinct from the other regions, which are the domains of one of the many [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/), Ytaj is a massive city/temple complex, which is heralded as the sacred meeting place of all the gods of the realm of Drehmal. This area is the most intricate build in the map of Drehmal, containing a vast array of grandiose white buildings, meeting halls, shrines, and living quarters of the gods themselves. It is located in the far north of Lo'Dahr's habitable area, extending out beyond the moon's otherwise roughly square boundaries.

Ytaj borders [[Vayniklah's Domain]] to the west, [[Moen's Domain]] to the south, [[Taihgel's Domain]] to the southeast, and [[Lahrs's Domain]] to the east. It is primarily accessed through a massive bridge that extends due north from Moen's Domain.
