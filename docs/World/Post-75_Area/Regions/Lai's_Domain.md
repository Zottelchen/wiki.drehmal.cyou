## Description { data-search-exclude }

![[lai_domain.png]]

**Lai's Domain** is one of 14 Aspect Domains on [[Lo'Dahr]], belonging to the Aspect of Warmth, Brightwyrm [[Lai]]. The region is made up almost entirely of a single massive red-and-black volcano. It is found in the far northeastern portion of Lo'Dahr's habitable area, bordering only [[Lahrs' Domain]] to the west and [[Taihgel's Domain]] to the south, sharing a strong resemblance to the latter region.

## Geography

Lai's Domain is predominantly taken up by one massive volcano, whose lava flows from a caldera at its peak down multiple paths to lava lakes, including a massive pool that forms the eastern edge of this domain and Taihgel's Domain. 

The terrain is dominated by red and black, formed primarily by Taihryte (netherrack), red terracotta, black concrete, and obsidian. 

Most of the structures in this area are built into hillsides, although there are some areas where the terrain is somewhat flat (most notably along the western border with Lahrs' Domain), and there are also sparse ponds and small lakes, including a large body of water in this western plateau. These bodies of water are surrounded by blue crystal trees, and red crystal trees can be found elsewhere in the region.

## Gameplay

Red Pseudodragons spawn in Lai's Domain.

Lai's Domain is also home to four types of hostile Nether mobs: two vanilla and two modified.

Vanilla Blazes and Magma Cubes spawn in Lai's Domain, throughout the region, and behave as usual.

## History

Lai's Domain has some [[Tehrmari]] inhabitants, although its history is not particularly clear. The Brulante family of noble [[Pyromancy|pyromancers]] lives in a manor in the northeast, and is said to possess a uniquely potent flame, distinct from those created by the various deities of Drehmal.

## Points of Interest

### Brightwyrm's Caldarium

The [[Brightwyrm's Caldarium]] is the site of Lai's [Trial](/World/Post-75_Area/Points_of_Interest/Trials/), and is accessed from a blackstone gateway at the top of the volcano.

**Coordinates:** (X: 1143, Y: 213, Z: -1232)

### Brulante Manor

The Brulante Manor is a structure located in the northeast of Lai's Domain, and the home of the Brulante family native to this region. They are the likely descendants of the author of the [[Scion's Diary]] book, and the structure is home to an [[Artifacts#Flamberge|artifact]] which hints at their family history.

**Coordinates:** (X: 1280, Y: 184, Z: -1312)

### Gateway Temple

In the far southwest of the region, a large blackstone/red Taihryte brick structure can be found, home to a quartz gate structure. The book found here, [[Pilgrim's Plea]], is one of two main hints in the map towards the activation method for these structures.

??? warning "Gate Info"
    This gateway is one of 6 portals between [[Overworld|Drehmal]] and [[Lo'Dahr]], and this one in particular is linked to the Totoron Lakes portal in [[Faehrcyle]]. Breaking a chiseled polished blackstone block beneath the structure's central campfire will reveal a chest with three amethyst shards, which can be used to activate the portal.
