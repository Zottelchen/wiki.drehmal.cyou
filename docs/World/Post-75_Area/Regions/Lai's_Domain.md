**Lai's Domain** is one of 14 Aspect Domains on [[Lo'Dahr]], belonging to the Aspect of Warmth, Brightwyrm [[Lai]]. The region is made up almost entirely of a single massive red-and-black volcano. The region sits in the far northeastern portion of Lo'Dahr's habitable area, bordering only [[Lahrs's Domain]] to the west and [[Taihgel's Domain]] to the south, sharing a strong resemblance to the latter region.
