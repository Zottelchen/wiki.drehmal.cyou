## Description { data-search-exclude }

![[taihgel_domain.png]]

**Taihgel's Domain** is one of 14 Aspect Domains on [[Lo'Dahr]], belonging to the dormant Elder Aspect of Land, [[Taihgel]]. This region bears a resemblance to the classical Minecraft nether wastes region, made up primarily of netherrack interspersed with yellow concrete and populated by standard Nether mobs. The region stretches from [[Moen's Domain]] in the west to the far eastern edge of Lo'Dahr's habitable area. It borders [[Lahrs' Domain]] in the northwest, [[Lai's Domain]] in the northeast, [[Nahyn's Domain]] in the southwest, and [[Noha's Domain]] in the southeast.

## Geography

Taihgel's Domain stretches east-west, gradually sloping down from the hills of Moen's Domain to the [[Lunar Wastes]] in the east. The ground in this region is primarily made of red terracotta and Taihryte (netherrack), named after the region's patron Aspect, with yellow concrete providing a secondary color around hills and small accents of white and black. The terrain is mostly flat, with the exception of hills leading up to neighboring domains around the borders and massive land arches throughout the region.

Some small bodies of water can be found in this region, in addition to large lava rivers and lakes originating from Lai's Domain in the northeast.

Strange yellow/orange pyramids and crystals grow out of the ground in some parts of this region, with particularly high density in the far east.

Custom red trees can also be found throughout the region, made of crimson hyphae and crucible wart (Nether wart) blocks.

There are some small areas in this region which look out of place, however. One tall plateau just east of the Core Facility is covered in mycelium and mushrooms, highly reminiscent of the terrain in Lahrs' Domain. Another massive arch is covered in regular dirt and grass blocks, and culminates in a large spruce wood tree.

## Gameplay

The mobs found in Taihgel's Domain are mostly vanilla Nether mobs, primarily Hoglins and Magma Cubes.

Custom ravagers with the name "Gohroson" also spawn in this region. They do not appear to have any custom attributes or behaviors beyond a slightly different skin.

## History

Little is known about the history of Taihgel's Domain itself. Its patron Aspect, [[Taihgel]], has been dormant for millennia by the time that the player awakens from stasis, and it is possibly that its terrain has changed during this period of inactivity.

This region was the home of [[Avsohm]]'s [[Core Facility]], the checkpoint that was tied to the [[Numencore]], which eventually became the center of their lunar operations.

## Points of Interest

### Core Facility

The [[Core Facility]] is a ruined [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] facility built into a hill, in the western portion of the region. It serves primarily as hub for exploration of the moon, providing a map with the locations of the other major [story locations on Lo'Dahr](/Story_and_Features/Story_Locations/Post-75_Locations/). It is linked to the [[Numencore]], with its main puzzle acting as a gateway to this final story location on the moon.

### Rainbow Puzzle

South of the Core Facility, a small black platform surrounded by several blackstone pillars can be found in a lake, with signs that give a puzzle. Starting from the purple sign to the west and cycling to the right, the signs read:

> If a rainbow puzzle it is you crave <br>
> Stand at the Obsidian Core <br>
> Look for the White Orb <br>
> Find a pillar that lines up with the gap <br>
> Line up the orb with the discolored patch <br>
> Behind the path there lies a cave

The "White Orb" in question is a snowball in an invisible item frame to the west, hovering in the air. The puzzle points the player to an artifact in a hidden location nearby.

**Coordinates:** (X: 470, Y: 14, Z: -710)

??? warning "Puzzle Solution"
    Standing on the obsidian block at the center of the platform and looking at the snowball, the object lines up almost perfectly with a 2x2 patch of gray concrete powder, which is a slightly different shade than the rest of the gray portion of the pillar it is a part of. Make your way up to this spot and dig through the concrete powder to reveal a hidden chamber, containing the [[Artifacts#Continent Crusher|Continent Crusher]] netherite pickaxe artifact.
