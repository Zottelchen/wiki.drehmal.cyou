**Taihgel's Domain** is one of 14 Aspect Domains on [[Lo'Dahr]], belonging to the dormant Elder Aspect of Land, [[Taihgel]]. This region bears a resemblance to the classical Minecraft nether wastes region, made up primarily of netherrack interspersed with yellow concrete and populated by standard Nether mobs. The region stretches from [[Moen's Domain]] in the west to the far eastern edge of Lo'Dahr's habitable area. It borders [[Lahrs's Domain]] in the northwest, [[Lai's Domain]] in the northeast, [[Nahyn's Domain]] in the southwest, and [[Noha's Domain]] in the southeast.
