# Lo'Dahr

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

![[zoomed_LD_map.png]]

The divine moon of **Lo'Dahr** is the home of the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/), and the second main dimension available to explore in Drehmal: Apotheosis. The habitable area of the moon encompasses slightly fewer than 3000 by 3000 blocks, making Lo'Dahr significantly smaller than Drehmal. However, the moon adds markedly more extravagant biomes, boasts builds that surpass those found on the main continent, and is even more densely packed with things to do and explore than Drehmal.

The moon is primarily inhabited by [[Tehrmari]] in-game, with Tehrmari settlements (and a few [[Drehmari]] ones) found throughout the habitable area of the moon. Lo'Dahr is home to 14 [Aspect Domains](/World/Post-75_Area/Regions/), the equivalent of regions, each of which is overseen and owned by one of the Aspects, in addition to the sacred region of [[Ytaj]] in the far north. Outside of these regions is the [[Lunar Wastes]] region, the collective name for the desolate area outside of Lo'Dahr's habitable area, which will quickly kill players who attempt to venture too far into it.

The player reaches Lo'Dahr through completion of the 75% completion event, touching down on a lake in [[Moen's Domain]] after completing the sequence at the [[Aphelion]]. There are [five main story locations](/Story_and_Features/Story_Locations/Post-75_Locations/) found on the divine moon, leading up to the late game sequence at [[Mt. Yavhlix]]. Lo'Dahr can also be accessed at any point through one of the 6 mysterious portals found on Drehmal, although the knowledge required to use them is mostly confined to the moon. It is also not recommended to do so, as accessing the moon via the intended story sequence makes for a much smoother experience, and the sequence beforehand offers important context on the moon itself.
