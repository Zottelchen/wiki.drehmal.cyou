# Lo'Dahr

The divine moon of **Lo'Dahr** is the home of the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/), and the second main dimension available to explore in Drehmal: Apotheosis. The habitable area of the moon encompasses roughly 2000 by 2000 blocks, making Lo'Dahr significantly smaller than Drehmal. However, the moon adds significantly more extravagant biomes, boasts builds that surpass those found on the main continent, and is even more densely packed with things to do and explore than Drehmal.

The moon is primarily inhabited by [[Tehrmari]] in-game, with Tehrmari settlements (and a few [[Drehmari]] ones) found throughout the habitable area of the moon.
