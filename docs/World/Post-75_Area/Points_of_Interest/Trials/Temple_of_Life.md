## Vayniklah's Trial
Reaching the Temple for the first time will play the following message in chat:

> A regretful nostalgia hangs on the warm breeze, and the sound of your heart beating is suddenly deafening.

This is accompanied by the "Temple of Life" advancement.

Inside the main temple structure, a series of six signs provides instructions:

> Atop four plots of copper ground,
>
> The trial-goer looks around.
>
> Espies four numbers, formed in wood
>
> Enormous shapes, now understood.
>
> Matching numbers and matching trees
>
> On painted bloom they stand at ease

??? question "Light Hint"
    Around the temple's exterior, there are four different 2x2 squares of waxed cut copper, each of which overlooks a certain spot in the area. Inside the main temple structure, there are four different custom player heads that can be right-clicked to change the number they display, cycling through the ten single-digit numbers. Each of these sits in front of a different kind of tree.

??? warning "Solution"
    At each of the copper plots, a number can be made out in the surroundings, tied directly to one of the four types of wood in the central temple. Select the numbers for each tree, then stand on the center of the glazed terracotta in the central structure to lock in your answers. If they are correct, the puzzle will be solved.
    ??? danger "Acacia"
        The acacia copper plot is found atop the temple, and overlooks the number 6 outlined in quartz, with an acacia tree next to it.

Successfully solving the puzzle will spawn a chest in the central temple structure, and play the victory message:

> Vayniklah congratulates your keen intuition.

The chest contains a copy of the [[Eldermead]] legendary item, as well as [[The Facets#Facet VI|Facet VI]].
