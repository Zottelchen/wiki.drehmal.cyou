## Dahr's Trial
Upon reaching the structure, the following message plays in chat:

This is accompanied by the "Abyssal Rise" advancement.

The inside of the building is flooded, with several small structures under the water which are protected by Dahrkin (Guardians). A set of signs lies at the center, around a single block of water. These signs read:

> Oh, how I wish you could return to me,
>
> Six lost treasures beneath the sea!
>
> So splendid within this pool you would be!

??? question "Light Hint"
    There are, indeed, six distinct items lost inside of this building underwater, each found in chests. They are spread out, mostly evenly around the center, and must be returned to the center as suggested.

    Returning each item gives a message in chat, which states: "The first/second/third/fourth/fifth/last of six has been returned."

??? warning "Solution"
    Find the six lost pearls underwater, and throw each of them into the pool at the center inside the signs.
