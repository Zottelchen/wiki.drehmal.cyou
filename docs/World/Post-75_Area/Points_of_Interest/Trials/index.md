# The Trials

The **Six Trials** are gameplay challenges and puzzles found at major points of interest throughout the moon of [[Lo'Dahr]]. Each of these trials is found in a different [Aspect Domain](/World/Post-75_Area/Regions/), spread out across the moon's area.

Each of the trials is indirectly given by one of the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/), framed as a trial to test your character in some way that pertains to that Aspect, and each Aspect's trial is found within their physical domain on Lo'Dahr. When a trial location is approached for the first time, the following message will play in chat:

> *The presence of divinity feels stronger here...*

This is followed by a unique dialogue line, played upon the first time that each individual trial location is discovered.

The Trials award the player with a unique item: either an artifact that makes up one piece of a full set of diamond armor, or a unique [Legendary item](/Items/Legendary_Items/). Each trial also rewards the player with a cryptic prophecy from [[Rihelma]], known as a [[The Facets|"Facet"]]. Completing a trial will play a unique dialogue line in chat, as well as informing the player of how many trials remain to be completed.

> Five Trials Remain...
> 
> Four Trials block your way...
>
> Three Trials still stand...
>
> Two Trials are left...
>
> A single Trial yet unconquered...

The Trials can be completed in any order that the player likes. When the final one is finished, the following message will be played:

> "Congratulations Aspirant. Seek the chapel beneath the domed meeting hall in Ytaj to claim your prize."

Completing all six trials will give the player access to a new area, where they may claim [[Syzygy|a powerful reward]].

## Location Hints
Hints towards the location of the 6 Trials can be found in the Prismatic Council chamber of [[Ytaj]], in the large domed building filled with thrones. On the walls around this room, there are six distinct murals, which depict the terrain around where one of the trials is found. 

The 6 Trials are spread somewhat evenly across the moon's area, with three in the west and three in the east. Trials can be found in the following regions: <br>
- [[Khive's Domain]] <br>
- [[Rihelma's Domain]] <br>
- [[Nahyn's Domain]] <br>
- [[Dahr's Domain]] <br>
- [[Lai's Domain]] <br>
- [[Vayniklah's Domain]]

Murals tied to the trials are also found in the room containing a family tree of the Deities and Aspects beneath the Prismatic Council Chamber, which will have the blocks in front of them lit on fire when completed. From left to right upon first entering the room, these are:

- [[Star-Rise Orrery|Rihelma's Trial]] (A long yellow trail on a blue/purple background) <br>
- [[Hypogean Labyrinth|Nahyn's Trial]] (A mountain, depicted as layers of stone, ice, and snow) <br>
- [[Brightwyrm's Caldarium|Lai's Trial]] (A series of flames) <br>
- [[Temple of Life|Vayniklah's Trial]] (Wood with moss blocks and black/yellow spots) <br>
- [[Mystic Gallery|Khive's Trial]] (Infused amethyst and red sandstone rings on a black background) <br>
- [[Abyssal Rise|Dahr's Trial]] (A stream of blue vaguely resembling a river)
