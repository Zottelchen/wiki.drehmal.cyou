**Ihted Academy** is a large dungeon in the center of the northern half of [[Khive's Domain]].

Once a center of arcane knowledge and higher education in the ancient Av1 city of Ihted, this structure was transplanted onto Lo'Dahr by [[Khive]] himself following some of the disastrous events at the end of that era.

Ihted Academy is home to multiple pertinent lore books, including [[Dread of the Ageless]] and the [[Codex Celestus]], the latter of which contains some of the Drehmal universe's deepest secrets, but which has not been fully deciphered.

The [[Magestep]] legendary boots are also located here.
