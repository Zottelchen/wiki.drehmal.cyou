**Ihted Academy** is a large dungeon in the center of the northern half of [[Khive's Domain]].

Once a center of arcane knowledge and higher education in the ancient Av1 city of Ihted, this structure was transplanted onto Lo'Dahr by [[Khive]] himself following some of the disastrous events at the end of that era.

Ihted Academy is home to multiple pertinent lore books, including [[Dread of the Ageless]] and the [[Codex Celestus]], the latter of which contains some of the Drehmal universe's deepest secrets, but which has not been fully deciphered.

The [[Magestep]] legendary boots are also located here.

## Contents

Ihted Academy is most easily accessed from a staircase in its northern face, which leads directly up to its ground floor. Here, a room to the left labeled "LIBRARY" holds the [[Tattered Schism Soldier's Journal]] book, which contains an account of a soldier who fought in the [[Divine Schism]].

Other rooms on this floor contain good loot, including one [[Runic Catalyst]]. The rooms are labeled with signs, including: ASPECT TEACHINGS, MINISTERIAL SCIENCE, INTRO TO CATALYSTS, INTRO TO ARCANISM, INTRO TO RUNIC MAGIC, and STORAGE.

A set of stairs in the central room leads up to the second floor, where APPLICATIONS OF MAGIC IN COMBAT and EXPRESSIONS IN MAGIC classrooms are found. Another set of stairs leads up to the third floor, containing eight dormitory rooms.

Another staircase leads up to the fourth floor, consisting of a balcony with a tower to the right. This tower has a spiral staircase, which leads up to the outside of the academy. Here, players will first be forced to engage with the Shackled Sentinel enemies.

The Shackled Sentinels are flying enemies based on the popular culture image of a "biblically accurate angel", close to some depictions of the [Ophanim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophanim). When they see a player, they will shoot magical projectiles at the player, which can only be blocked by the [[Eyebiter]] shield. Each Shackled Sentinel is visibly tethered to a stationary baby zombie. Normally, the sentinels are invulnerable, but killing their tethered baby zombie will also kill the sentinel.

Up a couple sets of stairs, another hallway leads back inside the academy building. This path eventually leads to a large lecture room with a single Shackled Sentinel, with full-block stairs on either wall that lead upwards. The path leads back to the outside again, and after climbing another set of stairs, the player will find themselves in a massive, 2-story library room. To the east, on the lower level, is a chest that holds the [[Dread of the Ageless]] book.

The final set of stairs leads out of this room to the north, and leads to the very top of Ihted Academy. Here, two Sentinels guard a fountain and one last room, which holds the final prizes for clearing Ihted Academy: the [[Magestep]] legendary boots and the [[Codex Celestus]].

## Lore

In the First Avihm, Ihted Academy was a hub for runic magic, and a massive collection of arcane knowledge. Seemingly taught by [[Khive]] himself, the students of the academy were plentiful. At this time, the academy was also in the city of Ihted, a massive city whose location has been fully lost to time. 

The academy is cited as the source of Khive's greatest tragedy, likely referring to [[Aok]]'s completion of the [[Great Work]] and invention of [[Necromancy]] in Av1. Following this tragedy, Khive physically transplanted the entire building to his domain on Lo'Dahr, effectively quarantining it without having to destroy a massive repository of knowledge.

The advancement states that the Mystics inhabit the academy's lower floors, implying that there are still students or disciples of Khive here. Unless they are the Shackled Sentinels or their tethers, this seems to no longer be the case. The only being clearly stated to reside here is Yvinahl, Khive's extremely mysterious disciple mentioned in the Magestep description.

Khive himself has also very likely spent time here, if he does not physically reside here. This is implied due to the presence of the [[Codex Celestus]] at the top of Ihted Academy, written by the Mystic Elder himself.
