The **Augural Tangle** is a hidden dungeon within Aldregakar, the massive mountain in the southeast of [[Rihelma's Domain]]. Full of divining crystals which are said to allow people to peer into the mind of [[Rihelma]] as she receives prophecies, the Augural Tangle is also the final resting place of [[Oriann]], and the location of the [[Aeongale]] legendary.
