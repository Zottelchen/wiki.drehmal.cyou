**Yriel's Sanctuary** (also called **Yriel's Tomb**) is a small habitable area in the southeastern [[Lunar Wastes]], only normally accessible by completing the [six trials](/World/Post-75_Area/Points_of_Interest/Trials/) found on the divine moon.

Upon completion of all six trials, a portal will appear in [[Ytaj]], in the room below the Prismatic Council Chamber. This portal takes the player to Yriel's Sanctuary, where they can find [[Syzygy]] and the [[The Facets#Facet VII|final Facet]].
