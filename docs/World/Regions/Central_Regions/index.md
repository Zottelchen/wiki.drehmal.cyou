# Central Regions

The three Central Regions are located in the geographic center of the continent of Drehmal, and are where the player first spawns. They all have relatively similar terrain, being extensions of the same plains.

**[[Capital Valley]]** is the heart of the central plains, and the place where a playthrough begins. Together with the Gulf of Drehmal, it makes up the Central Plains, also known in some sources as **Dreh'Noha**.

The **[[Gulf of Drehmal]]** is the northern part of Dreh'Noha, including some of the land north of Capital Valley.

**[[Palisades Heath]]** is located to the southwest of Capital Valley, and consists of towering cliffs and fjords.
