# Island of Dusk

![[DK_landscape.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

The **Island of Dusk** is an island region, recognizable by its vibrant purple and pink colors and massive flora. It is located in [[Overworld|Drehmal's]] far northwest, to the west of its paler counterpart, the [[Island of Dawn]].

## Geography

The Island of Dusk is located in the northwestern ocean, in close proximity to the Island of Dawn, which lies across a narrow strait to the east. The island is located north of the mainland regions of [[Casai]] and [[Merijool]].

The region is densely wooded with oak trees, and the terrain is mostly flat except for a multitude of thin rock outcrops and two mountains; one in the east and one in the west. The stone on landforms has purple, pink, and white stripes. Several patches of mycelium are dispersed throughout the island, on which a few giant mushrooms but no trees grow. The island is encircled by sand beaches.

There are no major settlements on the Island of Dusk.

## History

The island's ancient history is mostly unclear. It was likely uninhabited in the early Second Avihm, up until the Coven of [[Koh]] was established. The origins of this community are unknown, including the time at which they arrived, with the first and only mention of their presence dating to the very end of the Second Avihm. A few centuries before this, the island was incorporated into the [[Avsohm|Empire of Avsohm]] and it was mined for mendarum crystals, which were necessary for carving runes into [[rehntite]].

With [[Fall of Avsohm|Avsohm's fall]] came the start of the Third Avihm, throughout which the Coven of Koh continued to thrive. The island was rediscovered in Av3 298 by the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]], who probably revitalized the mendarum-mining industry with the goal of reproducing Avsohmic technology. The mines were once again abandoned with the Order's dissolution at the end of the Avihm. The Coven of Koh, however, continues to exist and practice their worship in isolation today.

## Terminus Tower

The Island of Dusk's [[Terminus Network#Towers|Terminus tower]] is situated in a mycelium field in the region's north-center. It is surrounded by three quartz towers with spruce walls at the tops and dark oak spires, each with a ring of color directly below the top portion. There is one very short tower with a red ring, one medium-sized tower with a green ring, and one tower the same size as the Terminus tower with a blue ring and a small turret connected to the top. A parkour course involving levitating stained glass blocks leads between and through these towers, ending at the Terminus tower's apex. There are no hostile entities present.

## Points of Interest

### Coven of Koh

The [[Coven of Koh]] is a society of [[Koh]]-worshiping cave-dwellers who have a long-established presence on the island. Although their specific history is unknown, they are known to have existed since the Second Avihm and had different beliefs than the Xorhai on the Island of Dawn. The subterranean settlement is located beneath the mountain in the island's northwestern corner, accessible via an entrance on its north side.

### Mines

A set of wooden beams and a large drill can be found in the eastern mountains of the Island of Dusk, used for the extraction of mendarum crystals. The [[Crystal Digging Claws]] legendary is located at the bottom of this pit.
