# Mt. Yavhlix

![[YV_landscape.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

**Mt. Yavhlix** is a small region in the far north of [[Overworld|Drehmal]], named after the large mountain at its core. The region's frigid land is mostly empty, but the mysterious and eerie Mt. Yavhlix itself is an important landmark in the game's lore and story, especially later into the game.

## Geography

The Mt. Yavhlix region is a peninsula protruding to the northwest of [[Faehrcyle]], and it is surrounded on its other sides by icy ocean. The world's northernmost point of land is in this region.

The Mt. Yavhlix region is ringed by snowy mountains on all sides, except for a narrow opening in the southeast which allows easy access from Faehrcyle to the region's interior. Inside the ring of mountains are two frozen lakes, one to the east and one to the west of Mt. Yavhlix, which sits at the center. The region lacks any vegetation, and the stone forming the landscape is all a monochromatic gray, often made of dead coral blocks.

There are no settlements in the Mt. Yavhlix region.

## History

Faehrcylian maps from the very beginning of the Second Avihm do not show Mt. Yavhlix, despite the surrounding coastline and land being documented. Around Av2 30, [[Noha]] began to notice abnormalities in the local wildlife, and pointed this out to [[Tethlaen]]. In Av2 32, Tethlaen ventured to the region themself to investigate, only to mysteriously vanish and never return. It is only after this event that records of Mt. Yavhlix began to appear. The concept of fear also seems to have gained an increased influence on Faehrcylian culture around this time, and the tribes came to revere the mountain.

Centuries later, [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] drones detected an energy signature emanating from inside of Mt. Yavhlix. After a conflict with the Faehrcylian tribes and the resulting [[Frostfang Catastrophe]], the empire ultimately secured control of the mountain and began excavation. A facility was built to collect [[primal energy]] from the source, which soon became Avsohm's most crucial endeavor, as the immense energy output was the key factor contributing to the empire's success and power. The mountain also seemed to be related to the [[Fall of Avsohm|empire's mysterious, catastrophic collapse]], and the entrance was sealed off during this time.

In the Third Avihm, [[Ultva|Master Ultva]] of the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]], fueled by his interest in Avsohm's technology and desire to attain the empire's level of power, supported attempts to unlock Mt. Yavhlix's entrance or penetrate the mountain using brute force. After years without any progress, however, the operation was abandoned. The door in the side of the mountain remains sealed to this day, guarding the lost knowledge within.

## Terminus Tower

Mt. Yavhlix's [[Terminus Network#Towers|Terminus tower]] is located inside of the Primary Energy Collection Facility within the mountain. Its label in the Terminus appears as "//ERROR//" before being unlocked. It is inaccessible until players have reached this dungeon.

## Points of Interest

### Mountain Entrance

![[yav_door.png]]

The entrance to the interior of Mt. Yavhlix, located on its southern face, takes the form of a giant doorway, now sealed by a black and gray stone barrier. Veilstone (bedrock) prevents it from being mined through. Built into the face of the mountain on either side are castle-like stone structures, which possibly served as a checkpoint for incoming personnel.

### Primary Energy Collection Facility

The [[Primary Energy Collection Facility]] was an Avsohmic facility built inside Mt. Yavhlix, with the purpose of collecting the vast amounts of energy pouring out of a secret, mysterious source concealed within the mountain. Therefore, it was arguably the empire's most important establishment, and the government was very secretive with information regarding it. No one has been able to access it since the time of Avsohm.

The Primary Energy Collection Facility is a significant dungeon in the end-game, and must be accessed through story progression.

### Void Maze

A secret pitch-black underground maze is located in the region, containing a [[Oblivion|valuable prize]]. The knowledge of the whereabouts of its entrance and the key needed are acquired through a longer quest.

### Soundtrack

When standing just outside of the large door at Mt. Yavhlix, a faint ambient track plays. This is "The Mountain of Holes", by Drehmal composer Chris Nesja.
