# Casai

![[CS_landscape.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

**Casai** (pronounced "cass-sigh") is an arid, mostly orange-colored region in northwestern [[Overworld|Drehmal]]. It is featured prominently in the game's lore, with the region having a distinct culture that has influenced other areas beyond Casai itself.

## Geography

Casai is located in the northwestern corner of the main continent. It borders [[Mt. Ebonfire]] to the south and [[Merijool]] to the east. The actual land border with Merijool is relatively short, with the Zephyr Sound separating the two regions from the middle of Casai's eastern edge up to the ocean in the north.

The region's landscape is extremely recognizable for its abundance of red (orange) sand, which forms the vast majority of the landscape. Its southern section is covered in acacia trees and patches of grass, as well as bluffs with white-and-yellow striped cliffs. The northern section (possibly called "the Redsteps") has less vegetation, and it is home to cliffs with red, orange, yellow and brown stripes. An area in the center is scattered with stone spires of the same color pattern. A peninsula and island chain on the region's north coast completely lack red sand, with the terrain consisting instead of grass and gray stone rocks.

**Environmental Sub-Regions:**

- Area with striped-sided bluffs, acacia trees and some grass in south <br>
- Area with some acacia trees and red, orange, yellow and brown striped spires in center <br>
- Plain red sand area with striped-sided bluffs and some snow, ice and acacia trees <br>
- Mountainous peninsula and island chain with stone, grass, and spruce and oak trees in north

The city of [[Athrah]] sits on the northern shore of Lake Athrah, in the north part of the region.

## History

Casai, like many other northern regions, originally had a different environment, being described as a "lush steppe" prior to the [[Frostfang Catastrophe]]. The Casain people first separated from the Ebohni tribe of the [[Ebony Veldt]] to the south in the early Second Avihm. They settled primarily in the region's central river valleys, which were more suitable for agriculture than the relatively infertile land that made up the rest of the region. Early Casains were known to have interacted with the Ebohni, but also the Merians (from Merijool) and the Tharhans. They began to divide into different tribes or clans, but maintained overall peace. This agricultural power and lack of conflict allowed Casain civilization to prosper, and cities were formed.

The warrior-king [[Athrah Zarha]] of the Zarha tribe in southern Casai sought to unite the region under one rule for the first time. In his conquests, he secured an area in the north of the region that was used to build a great new city and potential capital, [[Athrah]]. Athrah Zarha grew his domain by denying trade to non-conformers, and his kingdom eventually grew to the size where he declared the beginning of the [[Casain Empire]]. The Xorha Clan, the last resistance, killed the king in battle, and as such were banished from the region (eventually resettling on the [[Island of Dawn]] and founding [[Xor'Huul]]).

After a failed war to expand eastward into Merijool, the empire began settling the Ebony Veldt and coast of modern-day [[Anyr'Nogur]]. They then fought to gain the Tharhan lands controlled by [[Six Tharhan Kingdoms|six different kingdoms]], but were kept at bay by a third party from [[Caer Adacia]] who formed the [[Second Tharhan Empire]]. Despite their defeat, the Casain Empire retained its hold on its territory (as well as new parts of the Golden Sands), and the region entered the Casain Golden Age as the empire enjoyed peace and thriving trade with Tharhan.

Casai, along with most of the West, succumbed to [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] rule in the late Second Avihm, probably retaining status as a province of the empire. It was likely inducted through negotiation rather than conquest, as was customary for Avsohm. The Casains' traditional [[Voynahla]]-based religion was viewed with contempt by the new rulers and would eventually be outlawed. The [[Frostfang Catastrophe]] dried the region's land and made the climate colder, however the societal impact was less severe than that on other areas closer to the storm's epicenter.

When the [[Dune Wars]] commenced upon [[Fall of Avsohm|Avsohm's collapse]], fear grew in Casai about an invasion from [[Maelihs]]. Casains fled en masse to other regions, most prominently [[Akhlo'Rohma]], where a large Casain community still lives despite historical and ongoing discrimination and conflict with the natives.

It is unclear whether or not Casai was ever successfully absorbed into [[Empire of Maelihs|Maelihs's empire]], but the Casain Empire was independent by the late Third Avihm and became one of the later members of the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]]. Casai contributed to the Insohmic Coalition's efforts in the [[Battle for Drehmal]], and was likely granted new territory in doing so. 

The Order broke down at the end of the Third Avihm, and Maelihs retook all his land lost to the Coalition, extending as far north as [[Ebonrun]] in the north of the Mt. Ebonfire region. The Casain Empire, although still sovereign, is now confined to only the region of Casai itself and exists under the threat of attacks from Maelihs's forces.

## Terminus Tower

Casai's [[Terminus Network#Towers|Terminus tower]] is relatively short, sitting on a bluff in the region's north. Most of the spire is frozen in a large, conical chunk of ice. No hostile enemies are present.

## Points of Interest

### Athrah

[[Athrah]] is a city in northern Casai, positioned on the northern edge of the region's large red sand desert and on the north coast of Lake Athrah. It contains an old town, a slum, and a market, and the buildings have unique architecture that mostly uses acacia wood, red sandstone, and brown terracotta. The city has served as the capital city of the Casain Empire ever since its founding thousands of years ago.

### Avsohmic Vault

On a small island off the region's west coast is [[Avsohmic Vault|an Avsohmic vault]]. It was once one of many that were commissioned by [[Ifeihl|Emperor Ifeihl]] to store sensitive information pertaining to operations at [[Mt. Yavhlix]]. It was rediscovered by the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]], and efforts were made to open it in hopes of revealing long-lost knowledge that would empower the Order. The door was successfully opened, and [[Ultva|Master Ultva]] searched the information inside. He was supposedly affected mentally by something he read, driving him to lock himself inside, never to be seen again. [[Vahid|Master Vahid]] quickly discontinued the operation, and abandoned Insohmic construction and equipment can still be found at the vault's entrance. The [[Ultva's Bowblade]] legendary is found here.

### Perishing Well

The [[Perishing Well]] is a dark and empty shrine to Voynahla inside of a stone spire in the region's west, led into by a broken red sandstone bridge. It seems to have been in use since ancient times, as it was the site where the emperor of Casai received the prophecy that prompted the Tharhan War of Unification. The temple holds Voynahla's [[Devotion|devotion]] altar.

### Ruins of Sal'Lohd

The ruins of the former port town of Sal'Lohd sit on the east coast of Casai, along the Zephyr Sound. It was once an important location for Casain commerce, partly due to strict trade laws, and its markets were patrolled by the Lohdan Port Authority. The [[Artifacts#Inspector's Sidearm|Inspector's Sidearm]] artifact is found here.

### Ruins of Zarha

Zarha was a city in southern Casai that was home to the Zarha tribe, from which Athrah Zarha came. One other Zarha chieftain is known; Kazabar, who had a deep love for art and died by "consuming the toxic pigments within a particularly vibrant oil painting". The [[Artifacts#Foot Easels|Foot Easels]] artifact and a [[Fervor Stones#Stone of Luxury|Stone of Luxury]] are found here.

When viewed on a map, the above landform in Casai's western mountain range looks something like a smiley face, somewhat reminiscent of a donkey. Per co-creator Keeko100, this face may be called either "Grubby" or "Schlubby".
