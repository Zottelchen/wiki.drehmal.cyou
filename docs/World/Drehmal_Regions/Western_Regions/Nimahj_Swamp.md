## Geography

The swamp itself is divided into roughly four zones, with the northernmost characterized by huge near-vertical towers of rock (the tower rises from the top of the highest of these). Large areas of grassland and interconnected mesas surround and cross the swamp, connecting the Tharxax Plains in the east with the [[Anyr'Nogur]] desert in the west.

Regions that border Nimahj Swamp include:

- The [[Ebony Veldt]]
- [[Tharxax Plains]]
- The [[Carmine]]
- [[Anyr'Nogur]]

## Notable Locations
