## Geography 

The region is extremely volcanic, with almost its entire eastern border being a single vast lake of lava. The general geography is characterized by plains of lava, magma, and massive bones broken up by climbable ridges and, in the northern reaches, sheer bluffs of obsidian.

Regions that border The Carmine include:

- [[Tharxax Plains]]
- [[Lorahn'Kahl]]
- [[Crimson Gorge]]
