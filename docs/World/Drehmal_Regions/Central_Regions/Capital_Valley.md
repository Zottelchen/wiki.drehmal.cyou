# Capital Valley

![[Capital_Valley.webp]]{ align=right width="300" }

Capital Valley is a region in central [[Drehmal (Place)|Drehmal]], and the first one to be explored by the player. The region's landscape consists mostly of temperate plains and woods. The name "Capital Valley" dates back to [[Empire of Avsohm|Avsohmic]] times, when the empire's capital [[Av'Sal]] was located in the west of this region.

## Geography

Capital Valley encompasses the south part and the majority of the Central Plains (Dreh'Noha). The Mouth of Drehmal to the south gives the region a very brief coastline, and [[Palisades Heath]] and the [[North Heartwood]] flank the sea's west and east sides respectively. To the west, the Burnt Mountains run from north to south, separating Capital Valley from [[North Tharxax]] and the [[Ebony Veldt]]. The region borders the [[Gulf of Drehmal]] region to the north and [[Purity Peaks]] to the east]].

Capital Valley has relatively flat terrain, with some hills and small cliffs. The region is covered in grasslands and patches of oak and birch trees.

**Environmental Sub-Regions:**
- sprarse, tall forest with podzol in southwest
- small birch wood north of [[Primal Caverns]]
- thin valley with dense forest and podzol
- rugged area with small lakes in east

Capital Valley is home to the town of [[New Drabyel]] on the south coast, the smaller town of [[Solvei]] on the eastern edge of the region, and the very small village of [[Thesund]] at the foothills of the Burnt Mountains to the west.

## [[Terminus Network|Terminus]] Tower

Capital Valley's Terminus tower stands in the center of the region, next to the path between the Primal Caverns and the Drabyel Crossroads. It is the easiest tower in the map to climb, having a staircase leading to a ladder directly to the top. There are no hostile entities guarding the way.

| Hunter's Crypt |  |  | The Hunter's Crypt is a series of underground stone brick chambers, three of which contain the tombs of members of the hunting party that killed [Greatbeast Muhs[Muhs]]; Gahwyn the Hunter, Asrihk Clearbrook the Berserker and the Tracker (name unknown). The structure's purpose was as the player's initial spawn point before version 2.2.|
| New Drabyel |  |  | New Drabyel is a town sitting on a peninsula on the north coast of the Mouth of Drehmal, and usually the first town to be visited during a playthrough. Its buildings take the form of grassy mounds with wooden features. Drabyel was the capital of the [[Chosen Kingdom]] in the Second Avihm, and it became a large, crowded city. During the kingdom's transformation into the Empire of Avsohm, the capital was moved to the planned city of Av'Sal. Drabyel was likely almost completely destroyed at the end of the Second Avihm when Avsohm was [wiped out[Fall of Avsohm]], which would be why the modern town is named "*New* Drabyel". |
| Primal Caverns |  |  | The Primal Caverns is a cave inside of a steep green mountain, which sits between a similar red mountain to the west and a purple mountain to the east. These three peaks represent the three deities. This may be the site where the [[Primal Tree]] stood in the First Avihm, and Drehmal sleeps deep underneath the Primal Caverns today. |
| Ruins of Av'Sal |  |  | Av'Sal was a massive city which was ordered to be constructed by [[Drehn' Malsohm]] to serve as the capital of his newly founded Avsohmic Empire. Av'Sal's buildings ring a lake, and on a central island there is a Terminus tower and the [Repository[Av'Sal Repository]], an important story location. Most of Av'Sal was wrecked when Avsohm fell, and today the ruins are occupied by [[Mihkmari]] scavengers. |
