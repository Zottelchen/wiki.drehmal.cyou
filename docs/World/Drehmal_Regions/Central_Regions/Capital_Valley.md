# Capital Valley

![[Capital_Valley.webp]]{ align=right width="300" }

Capital Valley is a region in central [[Drehmal (Place)|Drehmal]], and the first one to be explored by the player. The region's landscape consists mostly of temperate plains and woods. The name "Capital Valley" dates back to [[Empire of Avsohm|Avsohmic]] times, when the empire's capital [[Av'Sal]] was located in the west of this region.

## Geography

Capital Valley encompasses the south part and the majority of the Central Plains (Dreh'Noha). The Mouth of Drehmal to the south gives the region a very brief coastline, and [[Palisades Heath]] and the [[North Heartwood]] flank the sea's west and east sides respectively. To the west, the Burnt Mountains run from north to south, separating Capital Valley from [[North Tharxax]] and the [[Ebony Veldt]]. The region borders the [[Gulf of Drehmal]] region to the north and [[Purity Peaks]] to the east]].

Capital Valley has relatively flat terrain, with some hills and small cliffs. The region is covered in grasslands and patches of oak and birch trees.

**Environmental Sub-Regions:**
- sprarse, tall forest with podzol in southwest

Capital Valley is home to the town of [[New Drabyel]] on the south coast, the smaller town of [[Solvei]] on the eastern edge of the region, and the very small village of [[Thesund]] at the foothills of the Burnt Mountains to the west. Drehmal is worshipped as the dominant religion in the region.

## History

Ancient Dreh'Nohan city states were abundant in modern-day Capital Valley in the early days of the Second Avihm. Despite being politically separated, the people of the region had a common culture. The first polity to unite the region's people was the [[Chosen Kingdom]], originating from Drahbes in the Gulf of Drehmal region, although the kingdom's capital was moved to Drabyel in the far south. 

When [[Drehn Mal'Sohm]] inherited the Chosen Throne, he reformed the government and commissioned a new capital city, Av'Sal. The newly born Avsohmic Empire ruled Capital Valley and most of the continent for a few centuries, a time during which quality of life massively improved for [[Drehmari]] due to discoveries in the field of technology. Being the empire's heartland, a severe blow was dealt with the [[Fall of Avsohm|catastrophe]] that ended Avsohm.

Some time in the Third Avihm, the independent towns of Capital Valley (and the Gulf of Drehmal) united as the [[United Townships of Dreh'Noha]], which became a member state of the [[Order of Insohm]]. Even after Insohm's fall, this united Dreh'Nohan state continued to exist and does so in the current day.

## [[Terminus Network|Terminus]] Tower(s)

Capital Valley's Terminus tower stands in the center of the region, next to the path between the Primal Caverns and the Drabyel Crossroads. It is the easiest tower in the map to climb, having a staircase leading to a ladder directly to the top. There are no hostile entities guarding the way.

There is also a short Terminus tower on Av'Sal's central island. The area surrounding the tower is inhabited by [[Mihkmari]].

|-|-|-|-|
| Hunter's Crypt |  | X: 325, Y: 46, Z: 341 | The Hunter's Crypt is a series of underground stone brick chambers, three of which contain the tombs of members of the hunting party that killed [Greatbeast Muhs](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/Muhs); Gahwyn the Hunter, Asrihk Clearbrook the Berserker and the Tracker (name unknown). The structure's purpose was as the player's initial spawn point before version 2.2.|
| New Drabyel |  | X: 531, Y: 67, Z: 1839 | New Drabyel is a town sitting on a peninsula on the north coast of the Mouth of Drehmal, and usually the first town to be visited during a playthrough. Its typical buildings take the form of grassy mounds with features of spruce and oak wood. Drabyel was the capital of the [[Chosen Kingdom]] in the Second Avihm, and it became a large, crowded city. During the kingdom's transformation into the Empire of Avsohm, the capital was moved to the planned city of Av'Sal. Drabyel was likely almost completely destroyed at the end of the Second Avihm when Avsohm was wiped out, which would be why the modern town is named "*New* Drabyel". The residents of New Drabyel worship Drehmal. |
| Primal Caverns |  | X: 869, Y: 64, Z: 489 | The Primal Caverns is a cave inside of a steep green mountain, which sits between a similar red mountain to the west and a purple mountain to the east. These three peaks represent the three deities. This may be the site where the [[Primal Tree]] stood in the First Avihm, and Drehmal sleeps deep underneath the Primal Caverns today. |
| Ruins of Av'Sal |  | X: -218, Y: 105, Z: 1645 | Av'Sal was a massive city which was ordered to be constructed by Drehn' Malsohm to serve as the capital of his newly founded Avsohmic Empire. Av'Sal's buildings ring a lake, and on a central island there is a Terminus tower and the capitol building above the [Repository[Av'Sal Repository]], an important story location. Most of Av'Sal was wrecked when Avsohm fell, and today the ruins are occupied by Mihkmari scavengers. |
| [Ruins of Ihted[Ihted]] |  | X: 1062, Y: 65, Z: 1097 | The original name of Ihted is unknown, but its ruins were named by archaeologists after a different city with similarities from the First Avihm. The town, sitting on the east bank of the Noroehl River, predates Avsohm, and it was left completely abandoned during the reign of [Emperor Ifeihl[Zorhis Ifeihl]] after its inhabitants were exiled for illegally worshiping Khive. The ancient ziggurat remains there until this day, being frequented by wandering mystics and serving as a [devotion[Devotion]] site for Khive. The ruins contain passageways and rooms hidden underground. |
| Solvei |  | X: 1559, Y: 79, Z: 800 | Solvei is a Drehmal-worshiping village lying on a small stream running from one lake to another near Purity Peaks. Its buildings are built mostly out of spruce, oak and grass. |
| [[Stasis Facility]] |  | X: 778, Y: 2, Z: 584 | The Stasis Facility is an underground complex near the Primal Caverns that houses tens of Avsohmic stasis pods. The player awakes in one of these pods after leaving the [[Spawn Tomb]], and they must escape via a staircase leading to an opening on the surface atop a steep rock. The Stasis Facility has a large, open room with trees to allow the player to gather basic materials after spawning, and a room with murals and signs telling the story of the Felling of the [[Primal Tree]] and the birth of the three deities. |
| Thesund |  | X: -375, Y: 109, Z: 758 | Thesund is a tiny Drehmal-worshiping village perched atop a cliff overlooking a lake below the Burnt Mountains. The settlement only has five buildings, made of wood (spruce and oak) and grass, all surrounding a central square. The village was likely founded shortly after Avsohm's collapse by surviving children. |
