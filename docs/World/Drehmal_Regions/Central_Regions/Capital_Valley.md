## In the Lore 
	
> The people of the central plains [[Capital Valley]] are a typical feudalistic, medieval society set in a grassy plain. Many different kingdoms claim this land, with the largest being Dorhend. Dorhend is considered to be the most influential power within Dreh’Noha, despite its territory only covering the western edges of the plains.  The plains is the birthplace of the Avsohmic Empire and where the Primal Caverns, Drehmal’s resting place, lies.
