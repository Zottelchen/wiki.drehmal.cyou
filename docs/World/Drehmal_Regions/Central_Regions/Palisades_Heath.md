Palisades Heath is a region in central Drehmal. The region is characterized by its deep fjords and rocky highlands. The region makes up most of the Mouth of Drehmal's west coast.

## Geography

Palisades Heath lies between the Gulf of Drehmal to the east and the Burnt Mountains to the east (with [[South Tharxax]] on the other side). To the north is [[Capital Valley]] and to the south is [[Lorahn'Kahl]].

Palisades Heath is divided into three segments by two rivers (plus one other one that separates the region from Capital Valley). The northernmost of the two is likely named the Erwu. These two rivers lie at the bottom of steep canyons with white-and-gray striped walls, and they run from glaciers flowing from the Burnt Mountains. These cliffs also make up the shores of the Mouth of Drehmal. The region's land is mostly plains, but there are some spruce and oak woods, mostly in the eastern half. The same white-and-gray striped pattern is prevalent throughout many of the region's rocky surfaces.

There are no sizable settlements in Palisades Heath. Drehmal is worshiped by the region's people.
