# Palisades Heath

Palisades Heath is a region in central Drehmal. The region is characterized by its deep fjords and rocky highlands. The region makes up most of the Mouth of Drehmal's west coast.

## Geography

Palisades Heath lies between the Gulf of Drehmal to the east and the Burnt Mountains to the east (with [[South Tharxax]] on the other side). To the north is [[Capital Valley]] and to the south is [[Lorahn'Kahl]].

Palisades Heath is divided into three segments by two rivers (plus one other one that separates the region from Capital Valley). The northernmost of the two is likely named the Erwu. These two rivers lie at the bottom of steep canyons with white-and-gray striped walls, and they run from glaciers flowing from the Burnt Mountains. These cliffs also make up the shores of the Mouth of Drehmal. The region's land is mostly plains, but there are some spruce and oak woods, mostly in the eastern half. The same white-and-gray striped pattern is prevalent throughout many of the region's rocky surfaces.

There are no sizable settlements in Palisades Heath. [[Drehmal]] is worshiped by the region's people.

## History

Palisades Heath was one of the first inhabitable areas created by Drehmal after the Felling of the [[Primal Tree]]. At the time, the land was referred to by the [[Rihselch]] name "Palisahd". The Drehmal-worshiping [[Ancient Drehua]] people emerged in this region, founding [[Drehua Temple]] and recording much of early history and accounts of interactions with Drehmal in books. Later in the Second Avihm, the region would become a hotspot for piracy, and pirates continued to inhabit the region when it came under the rule of the [Empire of Avsohm|Avsohmic Empire]]. Little is known about the region's history in the Third Avihm, but its reputation of outlaws continues to stand until this day.
