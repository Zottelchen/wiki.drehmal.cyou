Highfall Tundra is a cold region in northeastern [[Drehmal|Drehmal (Place)]] with plains, sparse woods and tundra. It is named after the city [[Highfall]], the region's center of attention.

## Geography

Highfall Tundra is situated on Drehmal's east coast. It borders the [[Frozen Bite to the north, [[Veruhkt Plateau]] to the west and [[Spearhead Forest]] to the southwest.

The region is split by a river and lake into north and south segmente. Highfall sits on an island at the mouth of the river. The southern segment includes grassland dotted with spruce and oak trees and a large peninusla with rocky, slightly-snowy terrain. In the northern segment are lowlands with small streams and spruce woods in the east, as well as dry land in the west, and highlands consisting of snow-covered tundra. Here, there are also several glaciers, acting as sources for rivers feeding into the eastern ocean.

Highfall Tundra is home to the city of Highfall. Worship of [[Virtuo]] is the most common local religion.
