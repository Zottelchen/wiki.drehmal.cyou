Highfall Tundra is a cold region in northeastern [[Drehmal|Drehmal (Place)]] with plains, sparse woods and tundra. It is named after the city [[Highfall]], the region's center of attention.

## Geography

Highfall Tundra is situated on Drehmal's east coast. It borders the [[Frozen Bite to the north, [[Veruhkt Plateau]] to the west and [[Spearhead Forest]] to the southwest.

The region is split by a river and lake into north and south segmente. Highfall sits on an island at the mouth of the river. The southern segment includes grassland dotted with spruce and oak trees and a large peninusla with rocky, slightly-snowy terrain. In the northern segment are lowlands with small streams and spruce woods in the east, as well as dry land in the west, and highlands consisting of snow-covered tundra. Here, there are also several glaciers, acting as sources for rivers feeding into the eastern ocean.

**Environmental Sub-Regions:**
- rocky peninsula in south
- sandy dried lakebed in west
- snowy highland tundra in east

Highfall Tundra is home to the city of Highfall. Worship of [[Virtuo]] is the most common local religion.

## History

Highfall has been the center of power in the region since the early days of the Second Avihm.

## [[Terminus Network|Terminus]] Tower

Highfall Tundra's Terminus tower is located in the region's center, nearby the main road. Four stone towers with tops shaped like bird heads surround it on each side. The southern one, the shortest, has a spiral staircase on its interior leading to its top. A bridge connects the top of this tower to the eastern tower, which is taller. A stairwell inside this tower climbs from the point where the bridge intersects with it, up to its top, where another bridge connects to the taller northern tower. This pattern repeats up until the roof of the western and tallest stone tower, which provides direct access to the top of the Terminus tower. This complex is guarded by hostile "Tower Defenders".
