# Black Jungle

The Black Jungle is a relatively large region in southeast Drehmal. The region is mostly covered in dense jungle, and pits of lava are also a common feature throughout its terrain. The name "Black Jungle" is most likely derived from the black volcanic sand that exists in some areas, especially the coasts.
