# Black Jungle

The Black Jungle is a relatively large region in southeast Drehmal, mostly covered in dense jungle. The region is also very volcanically active, meaning pits of lava are widely present throughout the terrain. The name "Black Jungle" is most likely derived from the black volcanic sand that exists in some areas, especially the coasts.

## Geography

The Black Jungle has a very diverse landscape. Most of the region is a large, thick, tropical forest. The trees here are almost all jungle wood, but there are rare instances of acacia as well. The trees' heights vary, but most are taller than the average trees of other regions. There are volcanic zones on the east coast that are free of any forest cover and have ground of red, orange and black hues. Two separate areas within the jungle also contain pools of lava. The Black Jungle has many cliffs and spires composed of white-and-turquoise striped stone. Black sand is present on all of the region's coastlines.
