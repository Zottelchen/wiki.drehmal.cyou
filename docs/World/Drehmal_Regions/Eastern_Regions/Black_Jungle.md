# Black Jungle

![[Black_Jungle.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

The Black Jungle is a relatively large region in southeast Drehmal, mostly covered in dense jungle. The region is also very volcanically active, meaning pits of lava are widely present throughout the terrain. The name "Black Jungle" is most likely derived from the black volcanic sand that exists in some areas, especially the coasts.

## Geography

The Black Jungle has a very diverse landscape. Most of the region is a large, thick, tropical forest. The trees here are almost all jungle wood, but there are rare instances of acacia as well. The trees' heights vary, but most are taller than the average trees of other regions. There are volcanic zones on the east coast that are free of any forest cover and have ground of red, orange and black hues. Two separate areas within the jungle also contain pools of lava. The Black Jungle has many cliffs and spires composed of white-and-turquoise striped stone. Black sand is present on all of the region's coastlines.

[[Firteid]], the largest city in the game, is located in the region's west. It straddles between the mainland's coast and inland riverbank, and the Turquoise Isle. Worship of [[Virtuo]] is the primary religious faith in the Black Jungle.

## History

The oldest evidence of civilization in the Black Jungle is of a large, [[Verrhys]]-worshiping city that was ruled by a monarch, whose population was mysteriously exterminated.

The region was subjugated under the [[Empire of Vir]] in the mid Second Avihm, and the land was held under a firm, protective grip, until the empire's eventual collapse. Due to the new lack of central authority, [[Sahdan|Sahd]] criminals were disposed of by being exiled across the sea to the Black Jungle. These rampant outlaws likely posed a problem for the native inhabitants of the region. The [[Tidal Dynasty]] soon rose to power, ruled by the tyrannical [[Tide Queen]] from the city Firteid, and established control over the entire jungle. This marked the beginning of a long period of oppression.

The region was never conquered by the [[Empire of Avsohm|Avsohmic Empire]], in order to not engage in a bloody and costly war with the Tidal Dynasty's vast army. In the Third Avihm, the dynasty became isolationist and all foreigners were banned from its lands, other than a designated port. The Tidal Dynasty partook in the [[Insohmic Civil War]], joining forces with the [[Order of Insohm|Insohmic]] separatists against the loyalists. Soon afterwards, the dynasty's abuse of its power to exploit maritime trade prompted Insohm to secretly stir unrest in Firteid, ultimately leading to the Tide Queen's assassination.

The [[Tidal War]] was fought between the Tidal military and Virtuo's Grand Parish (backed by the Insohmic Coalition) to determine the succeeding government. After a long conflict, in which Virtuo was injured in an attack by [[Maelihs]], Insohm and the Parish emerged victorious and founded the [[Parochial Enclave of Firteid]]. The Enclave remained as a member of Insohm until the Order's collapse, and it still governs Firteid today.
