# Spearhead Forest



Spearhead forest is a relatively large region in eastern [[Drehmal (Place)|Drehmal's]]. The region's landscape is comprised of spruce forest and grassland. Its name references the pointed, coniferous trees that heavily populate the area.

## Geography

Spearhead forest is located on and encompasses a large portion of the east coast of Drehmal. The region is bordered by the Nahynaga Mountains to the west, separating it from [[Purity Peaks]] and the [[North Heartwood]], and the Verdant Mountains (including the [[Verdant Labyrinth]]) to the south, forming a boundary with the [[Black Jungle]] and Eye of Vir. It also borders [[Grand Pike Canyon]] to the northwest and [[Highfall Tundra]] to the northeast.

The western, inland section and majority of the region's land area is covered in forest with tall spruce trees and partial-podzol floor. The areas near the northern and mid shore are more open and grassy, and the spruces are thinly dispersed. Two large islands lay a substantial distance away from the mainland in the ocean to the southeast. The region's terrain is mostly flat, with a few small cliffs (especially along the shoreline) and crags with gray, white and beige stone.

Spearhead Forest is home to the coastal town of [[New Mossfield]] on a peninsula in the southeast and the small village of [[Helmshire]] in the western forest, below the Nahynaga mountains. [[Virtuo|Virtuo's]] faith is the region's dominant religion.

## History

[...]

In the mid Third Avihm, the introduction of airships used for trading brought about the rapid growth of the port city of Mossfield. When the [[Order of Insohm]] was established, it was initially based here before [[Castle Hovadchear Crater|Castle Hovadchear]] was constructed in the region's southwest and instated as headquarters. An independent state known as the "Insohmic Commonwealth" was also founded in Mossfield to preside over the Order of Insohm.

The Order was joined by many countries, including the Provinces of Vir, which had likely formed in the north of the region earlier in the Avihm. Both the Insohmic Commonwealth and Provinces of Vir fought against separatists to secure the Order's unity during the [[Insohmic Civil War]], and emerged victorious. It is also probable that they acquired territory in the West during the [[Battle for Drehmal]].

After the sudden disappearance of [[Vahid|Master Vahid]] at the end of the Third Avihm, the Order of Insohm devolved into chaos, resulting in the destruction of Mossfield and the alliance's dissolution. Today, only the Insohmic Commonwealth in the smaller town of New Mossfield claims affiliation with the Order.
