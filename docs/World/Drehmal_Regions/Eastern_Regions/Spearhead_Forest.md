# Spearhead Forest



Spearhead forest is a relatively large region in eastern [[Drehmal (Place)|Drehmal's]]. The region's landscape is comprised of spruce forest and grassland. Its name references the pointed, coniferous trees that heavily populate the area.

## Geography

Spearhead forest is located on and encompasses a large portion of the east coast of Drehmal. The region is bordered by the Nahynaga Mountains to the west, separating it from [[Purity Peaks]] and the [[North Heartwood]], and the Verdant Mountains (including the [[Verdant Labyrinth]]) to the south, forming a boundary with the [[Black Jungle]] and Eye of Vir. It also borders [[Grand Pike Canyon]] to the northwest and [[Highfall Tundra]] to the northeast.

The western, inland section and majority of the region's land area is covered in forest with tall spruce and oak trees and partial-podzol floor. The areas near the northern and mid shore are more open and grassy, and the spruces here are thinly dispersed. A large lake filled with gigantic lilypads and flowers lies in the region's center. Two large islands lay a substantial distance away from the mainland in the ocean to the southeast. The region's terrain is mostly flat, with a few small cliffs (especially along the shoreline) and crags with gray, white and beige stone. Beaches of gravel, dirt and clay line the coast.

**Environmental Sub-Regions:**
- spruce and oak coniferous forest in west
- sparsely wooded grassland in east
- wooded islands in southeast

Spearhead Forest is home to the coastal town of [[New Mossfield]] on a peninsula in the southeast and the small village of [[Helmshire]] in the western forest, below the Nahynaga mountains. [[Virtuo|Virtuo's]] faith is the region's dominant religion.

## History

[...]

In the mid Third Avihm, the introduction of airships used for trading brought about the rapid growth of the port city of Mossfield. When the [[Order of Insohm]] was established, it was initially based here before [[Castle Hovadchear Crater|Castle Hovadchear]] was constructed in the region's southwest and instated as headquarters. An independent state known as the "Insohmic Commonwealth" was also founded in Mossfield to preside over the Order of Insohm.

The Order was joined by many countries, including the Provinces of Vir, which had likely formed in the north of the region earlier in the Avihm. Both the Insohmic Commonwealth and Provinces of Vir fought against separatists to secure the Order's unity during the [[Insohmic Civil War]], and emerged victorious. It is also probable that they acquired territory in the West during the [[Battle for Drehmal]].

After the sudden disappearance of [[Vahid|Master Vahid]] at the end of the Third Avihm, the Order of Insohm devolved into chaos, resulting in the destruction of Mossfield and the alliance's dissolution. Today, only the Insohmic Commonwealth in the smaller town of New Mossfield claims affiliation with the Order.

## Points of Interest

### Castle Hovadchear Crater

Castle Hovadchear was once the grand headquarters of the Order of Insohm and likely the home of [[Hovadchear Myrik|Master Hovadchear]] himself. In the late Third Avihm, the entire building as well as the ground beneath it suddenly vanished, leaving only a large crater behind. Today, a small, stone building overlooking the crater contains a memorial to Hovadchear Myrik, which is guarded by "The Mourner".

### Helmshire

Helmshire is a small village within the forest of the region's west. Its buildings use various types of wood, as well as brick, stone and concrete. The village experienced a period of time in the late Third and early Fourth Avihm in which children were frequently abducted by a local Skeveraan for experimentation. Half of the population eventually left for [[Akhlo'Rohma]].

### Insohmic Coven of Potentia

The Coven of Potentia was a group of "Chosen", who were [[Drehmari]] selected by the Order of Insohm for having relatively high perceived potentia (power of soul). They were trained at a facility on the eastern shore of an island far to the east of continental Spearhead Forest, with the goal of unlocking power that could be harnessed by the Order. The Chosen were physically threatened to be kept under control. The building and the surrounding woods were burnt down when one powerful member went rogue, causing operations to cease. Rhalon, [[Maelihs's|Maelihs]] first [[Burnt General]], set out on an expedition in the Fourth Avihm with several guards to explore the ruins of the Coven of Potentia, where they still dwell today.

### [[Insohmic Library Tower]]

The Insohmic Library Tower stands on an island to the east of the ruins of Mossfield. It was used as the headquarters of the Order of Insohm after the disappearance of Castle Hovadchear, and the old Insohmic Council members continue to reside here.

### Lily Meadows Inn

Lily Meadows Inn is a colorful inn in central Spearhead Forest, on a small island amidst a large lake with giant lilypads and flowers. It contains many rooms and a restaurant, along with several traders.
