# Spearhead Forest



Spearhead forest is a relatively large region in eastern [[Drehmal (Place)|Drehmal's]]. The region's landscape is comprised of spruce forest and grassland. Its name references the pointed, coniferous trees that heavily populate the area.

## Geography

Spearhead forest is located on and encompasses a large portion of the east coast of Drehmal. The region is bordered by the Nahynaga Mountains to the west, separating it from [[Purity Peaks]] and the [[North Heartwood]], and the Verdant Mountains (including the [[Verdant Labyrinth]]) to the south, forming a boundary with the [[Black Jungle]] and Eye of Vir. It also borders [[Grand Pike Canyon]] to the northwest and [[Highfall Tundra]] to the northeast.

The western, inland section and majority of the region's land area is covered in forest with tall spruce trees and partial-podzol floor. The areas near the northern and mid shore are more open and grassy, and the spruces are thinly dispersed. Two large islands containing oak trees lay a substantial distance away from the mainland in the ocean to the southeast. The region's terrain is mostly flat, with a few small cliffs (especially along the shoreline) and crags with gray, white and beige stone.
