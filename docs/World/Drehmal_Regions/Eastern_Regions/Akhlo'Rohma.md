# Akhlo'Rohma

Akhlo'Rohma is a relatively large region in northeast [[Drehmal (Place)|Drehmal]]. The region is distinguished by its giant flowers and vibrant-colored cliffs. The name "Akhlo'Rohma" means "Long Rest" in [[Rihselch]].

## Geography

Akhlo'Rohma makes up the east coast of the Gulf of Drehmal. A mountain range divides the region from [[Faehrcyle]] to the north, and the Nahynaga Mountains separate the it from [[Grand Pike Canyon]] to the southwest. The region also borders [[Veruhkt Plateau]] to the east, [[Purity Peaks]] to the south and the [[Gulf of Drehmal]] region to the southwest.

Akhlo'Rohma is densly populated with gigantic flowers. Based on the type of flowers present, the region can be split into three distinct horizontal segments:
- North: The northern segment includes all Akhlo'Rohman land north of the Resting River (a large river flowing from Veruhkt Plateau in the east out into the Gulf of Drehmal to the west). The flowers here are all almost entirely white.
- Middle: The flowers of the middle segment consist of a pink, red and gold color pallette.
- South: The southern segment has flowers that are primarily purple and blue, but also have red, pink and gold/yellow features.
There is also the [[Sunken Astral Body]], a large, stone island riddled with craters, hidden in a lake surrounded by mountains. The Akhlo'Rohman landscape features bluffs and rocks with vividly-colored stone,  mostly dark pink and red, but also with some stripes of yellow, blue and green.

**Ecological Sub-Regions:**

- strip of land with white flowers in north
- strip of land with pink flowers in center
- strip of land with purple flowers in south
- Sunken Astral Body in southeast

The city of [[Dusps]] is located in south Akhlo'Rohma, along with the small village of [[Marahza]] to the north, on the south banks of the Resting River. [[Virtuo]] is the most commonly worshiped deity in the region, but worship of [[Voynahla]] is also prevalent among the local [[Casai|Casain]] communities. [[Vayniklah]] is also worshiped by a select few.

## History

The city state of Ancehl, on the west coast of Akhlo'Rohma, decided not to affiliate themselves with either side during the [[Deity War]] in the early Second Avihm, and subsequently grew rich in their time of peace. All of Akhlo'Rohma was eventually united under the rule of Ancehl's duke. The first school of [[Alchemy|alchemy]], Asomatous Alchemy, was created by the nobles of Ancehl.

Akhlo'Rohma was one of the first territories to be acquired by the [[Empire of Avsohm]]. It was in the mountains on the northern border of this region that a [[Rehnite Cave|cave]] yielding  an extraordinary amount of rehnite was found. This mining site would become integral to Avsohm's runic technology industry.

After [[Fall of Avsohm|Avsohm's fall]], Ancehl resumed its position of power. The region was populated by an influx of [[Casai|Casain]] immigrants, seeking refuge from the [[Dune Wars]] in the west. These communities were met with discrimination, especially by the government in Ancehl, who scorned their worship of [[Voynahla]] and saw them as cursed. This led to the [[Dohval Civil War]], in which Casains rebelled against Ancehl and burned down the city, only leaving the [[Ancehl Castle|castle]]. The war resulted in a reformation of the government, lending a share of political power to a parliament based in Dusps (the state was renamed as the [[Kingdom of Dusps]]).

The Kingdom of Dusps became a member of the [[Order of Insohm]], and they participated in the [[Battle for Drehmal]]. This allowed the kingdom to be allotted a colony in the [[Ebony Veldt]] by [[Vahid|Master Vahid]]. While the Order crumbled, and the Insohmic Council was in an incapacitated state, Akhlo'Rohma was raided by [[Maelmari]] in an event known as "[[Gendrik's Incursion]]". The Kingdom of Dusps's western territories were also reclaimed by the [[Empire of Maelihs]].
