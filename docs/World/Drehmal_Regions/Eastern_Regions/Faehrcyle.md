Faehrcyle is a relatively large region in the far north of [[Drehmal (Place)|Drehmal]]. The region has a very harsh, icy environment, and most of its land is coated in a thick layer of snow.

## Geography

Faehrcyle encompasses most of Drehmal's eastern north coast. The [[Mt. Yavhlix]] peninsula protrudes from the region's northwest. Two different conjoining mountain ranges separate Faehrcyle from [[Akhlo'Rohma]] to the south and the [[Frozen Bite]] to the east. The region is surrounded by ocean in the north and west.

Faehrcyle's terrain is mostly flat, and the vast majority of its land area is covered in a thick sheet of snow and void of any plant life. The region is also home to many frozen lakes and rivers, and the stone cliffs in the west are covered in ice
