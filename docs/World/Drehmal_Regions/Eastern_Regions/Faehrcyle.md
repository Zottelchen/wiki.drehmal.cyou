# Faehrcyle

![[Faehrcyle.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

Faehrcyle is a relatively large region in the far north of [[Overworld|Drehmal]]. The region has a very harsh, icy environment, and most of its land is coated in a thick layer of snow.

## Geography

Faehrcyle encompasses most of Drehmal's eastern north coast. The [[Mt. Yavhlix]] peninsula protrudes from the region's northwest. Two different conjoining mountain ranges separate Faehrcyle from [[Akhlo'Rohma]] to the south and the [[Frozen Bite]] to the east. The region is surrounded by icy ocean in the north and west.

Faehrcyle's terrain is mostly flat, and the vast majority of its land area is covered in a thick sheet of snow and void of any plant life. The region is also home to many frozen lakes and rivers, and some of the stone cliffs are also encased in ice. Along the central north coast, there is a very distinct strip of gray and black land with scattered volcanoes and large lava pools. The heat here leaves very little snow on the ground.

**Environmental Sub-Regions:**
- living spruce forest on west coast
- area with frozen rivers and lakes and massive, slanted ice spikes in east
- black and gray volcanic zone with abundant lava in north
- snowy plain with many small, icy cracks in northeast

The small town of [[Schlonko]] sits on Faehrcyle's west coast, amidst the region's only living forest. Its inhabitants worship the [Aspect](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) [[Loe]].

## History

Faehrcyle was originally a moderately cold, grassy steppe, rather than the frozen wasteland it is today. The region is known to have been inhabited since the first decades of the Second Avihm, with the local peoples organized into tribes/clans. After the nearby disappearance of the Aspect [[Tethlaen]], the Faehrcylian people began to worship him, and fear became ingrained into the region's culture.

By the late Second Avihm, Faehrcyle was divided between seven clans. They all joined together under the leadership of [[Homli Tahsgan]] in order to fend off an attack from the [[Empire of Avsohm]], who was trying to secure passage to Mt. Yavhlix to uncover the source of energy inside. Homli Tahsgan attempted to use magic against Avsohm's army, and unintentionally created a blizzard so strong that it would have a permanent environmental impact across northern Drehmal. Faehrcyle suffered a transformation into an inhospitable, frozen tundra. The majority of the tribespeople dispersed to surrounding areas that were less affected, and Avsohm took control of the region (or at least the western part).

In the Third Avihm, several kingdoms arose in Avsohm's wake and united under the Federation of Faehrcylian Kingdoms. This federation, along with the organized remnants of the Faehrcylian tribes, joined the [[Order of Insohm]]. In the [[Insohmic Civil War]], the Federation took sides with the loyalists and the tribes with the separatists. The tribes surrendered after the capitulation of both of their allies. 

Today, the only known political state in Faehrcyle is the Duchy of Hishrin in the forested area on the region's west coast. It is ruled by the egotistical Archduke Hishrin Elsahr Ombahr Drehn-Anyr Hovadchear Vahidson I.

## [[Terminus Network|Terminus]] Tower

Faehrcyle's Terminus tower is located in the region's center, and most of it is buried in snow and underground. There are no hostile entities present.

### Schlonko

Schlonko is a small port town on the western coast of Faehrcyle, and is the capital of the Duchy of Hishrin. Its buildings are constructed of spruce and dark oak wood. The Crystalline Colonnade, a temple to Loe containing her [[Devotion|devotion]] altar, sits on a bluff above the town.
