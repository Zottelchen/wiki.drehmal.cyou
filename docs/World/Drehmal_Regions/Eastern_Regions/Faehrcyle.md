Faehrcyle is a relatively large region in the far north of [[Drehmal (Place)|Drehmal]]. The region has a very harsh, icy environment, and most of its land is coated in a thick layer of snow.

## Geography

Faehrcyle encompasses most of Drehmal's eastern north coast. The [[Mt. Yavhlix]] peninsula protrudes from the region's northwest. Two different conjoining mountain ranges separate Faehrcyle from [[Akhlo'Rohma]] to the south and the [[Frozen Bite]] to the east. The region is surrounded by ocean in the north and west.

Faehrcyle's terrain is mostly flat, and the vast majority of its land area is covered in a thick sheet of snow and void of any plant life. The region is also home to many frozen lakes and rivers, and some of the stone cliffs are also encased in ice. Along the central north coast, there is a very distinct strip of gray and black land with scattered volcanoes and large lava pools. The heat here leaves very little snow on the ground.

**Environmental Sub-Regions:**

- living spruce forest on west coast
- area with frozen rivers and lakes and massive, slanted ice spikes in east
- black and gray volcanic zone with abundant lava in north
- snowy plain with many small, icy cracks in northeast

The small town of Schlonko sits on Faehrcyle's west coast, amidst the region's only living forest. Its inhabitants worship the Aspect [[Loe]].
