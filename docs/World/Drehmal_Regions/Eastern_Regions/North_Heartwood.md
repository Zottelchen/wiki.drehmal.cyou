The North Heartwood is a region in central-eastern [[Drehmal (Place)|Drehmal]], and the northern part of the greater Heartwood region. As its name suggests, its landscape is densely forested, to the point where the shade allows mobs to spawn at all times in most places.

## Geography

The North Heartwood stretches from the eastern shores of the Mouth of Drehmal to the Nahynaga Mountains, Verdant Mountains and Eye of Vir to the east. The Nahynaga Range forms a boundary between this region and the [[Spearhead Forest]], and the [[Verdant Labyrinth]] provides a means of reaching the [[Black Jungle]] on its far side through the Verdant Mountains. The region also borders the [[South Heartwood]] to the south, [[Purity Peaks]] to the north and [[Capital Valley]] to the northwest.

The North Heartwood's environment is relatively uniform. Nearly the entire region is covered in thick dark oak forest (with varying levels of density), also populated by tree-sized mushrooms with white stems and red, orange and yellow caps. A few oak and birch trees are also present. The typical trees that are found throughout the region are short and broad, with drooping foliage and outstretched roots. The terrain is dominated by many plateaus, and purple or brown cliffs and rocks. A small section of land in the region's southeastern corner, on the coast of the Eye of Vir, consists of grassland and small patches of woods. Sand beaches can also be found across the region's coasts.

**Environmental Sub-Regions:**
- sparse forest in northwest
- hilly grassland and woods in southeast
- grassland valley with lake and river in southwest
- the Underwood in southwest

The North Heartwood is home to the [[Drehmal]]-worshiping town of [[Gozak]] in the eastern forest.

## History

In the Second Avihm, several different kingdoms emerged in the Heartwood. One of these was the [[Gozaki Union]] (centered in Gozak), which was likely formed as a result of multiple states merging, as implied by its name. The Aspect [[Muhs]] also made his home in the North Heartwood. The [[Tidal Dynasty]] clashed with the Gozaki Union and seized some of its territory. Soon, the rest of the region came under [[Empire of Avsohm|Avsohmic]] rule.

After the [[fall of Avsohm|Fall of Avsohm]], the Gozaki Union and other kingdoms were revived. Gozak joined the [[Order of Insohm]] in its early years, and fought with the loyalists in the [[Insohmic Civil War]]. It was during this war that they were invaded by the Tidal Dynasty again, who was defeated, and the separatists also ultimately surrendered. The North Heartwood served as an important region for the Order of Insohm's mining, research and military operations.

By the Fourth Avihm, the only kingdom remaining in the North Heartwood was Gozak.
