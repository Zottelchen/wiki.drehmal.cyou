# South Heartwood

The South Heartwood, also known as [[Maelihs|Mael's]] Desolation, is a region in south [[Drehmal (Place)|Drehmal]], and the southern part of the greater Heartwood region. It has a dry, barren landscape, with deformed terrain and almost no living plant life.

## Geography

The South Heartwood is located on the south coast of Drehmal. The region borders the [[North Heartwood]] to its north, and the Eye of Vir and Strait of Vir to its east. On its west side, an isthmus cuts the Mouth of Drehmal of from the southern ocean, and connects to [[Palisades Heath]] and [[Lorahn'Kahl]].

Although most of the region is scarred, unarable and lacking vegetation, its western isthmus serves as an exception. This land is still heavily forested by dark oak trees, very similar to the North Heartwood. The land to the east of this sustains the most severe damage, most notably the [[Epicenter of Mael's Desolation|epicenter of the desolation]], which takes the form of an enormous, blackened crater. Its surrounding areas to the south and east are also charred and riddled with firey pits. The other parts of the region are mostly plains consisting of sand, dirt and sandstone, sometimes with ground scored by trenches.

**Environmental Sub-Regions:**
- isthmus with dark oak forest and prismarine cliffs in west
- epicenter of desolation in west
- blackened islands in southwest
- field with firey pits in center
- desert in east
- rugged, partially sandy area in northeast
- area with deep, red-sandstone-lined trenches in north

The [[Dahr]]-worshiping, half-[[Mihkmari]] town of [[Port Solitude]] is situated on the region's southern coast, as well as [[Tahva]], which straddles two islands in the southwest.

## History

The South Heartwood was originally a large forest similar to the North Heartwood, but with a warmer climate and unique flora, such as banyan trees. In the Second Avihm, the Kingdom of Espinor arose in the east, before becoming an [[Empire of Avsohm|Avsohmic]] governorate as the region was subjugated by the empire.

After [[Fall of Avsohm|Avsohm's fall]] at the end of the Second Avihm, the Kingdom of Espinor regained independence. Some time in the early Third Avihm, Maelihs decided to orchestrate the [[Desolation of the South Heartwood|thorough obliteration of the majority of the South Heartwood]] as a threat and statement of power to all [[Drehmari]], particularly those who were devout to [[Virtuo]]. The boundaries of the target area were drawn, and the Skullbeasts and [[Skullmother]] herself were unleashed and allowed to freely ravage the designated swath of land. This resulted in the slaughter or displacement of the region's entire population, the utter eradication of nearly all of the affected area's dense forest and vegetation, and the permanent aridification (and sometimes scorching) of the soil.

The South Heartwood was resettled by a few groups of people after this calamity, especially pirate communities on the southern coast who took advantage of the region's isolated lawlessness and safety. 

## [[Terminus Network|Terminus]] Tower

The South Heartwood's Terminus tower is located in the desert in the region's east. A small slope of sand leans against its base, allowing access to the first of the protruding beams of red sandstone that are scattered across the tower's eastern side. These beams collectively form a parkour course that can be climbed to the top of the tower. There are no hostile entities present.
