# South Heartwood

The South Heartwood, also known as [[Maelihs|Mael's]] Desolation, is a region in south [[Drehmal (Place)|Drehmal]], and the southern part of the greater Heartwood region. It has a dry, barren landscape, with deformed terrain and almost no living plant life.

## Geography

The South Heartwood is located on the south coast of Drehmal. The region borders the [[North Heartwood]] to its north, and the Eye of Vir and Strait of Vir to its east. On its west side, an isthmus cuts the Mouth of Drehmal of from the southern ocean, and connects to [[Palisades Heath]] and [[Lorahn'Kahl]].

Although most of the region is scarred, unarable and lacking vegetation, its western isthmus serves as an exception. This land is still heavily forested by dark oak trees, very similar to the North Heartwood. The land to the east of this sustains the most severe damage, most notably the [[Epicenter of Mael's Desolation|epicenter of the desolation]], which takes the form of an enormous, blackened crater. Its surrounding areas to the south and east are also charred and riddled with firey pits. The other parts of the region are mostly plains consisting of sand, dirt and sandstone, sometimes with ground scored by trenches.

**Environmental Sub-Regions:**
- isthmus with dark oak forest and prismarine cliffs in west
- epicenter of desolation in west
- blackened islands in southwest
- field with firey pits in center
- desert in east
- rugged, partially sandy area in northeast
- area with deep, red-sandstone-lined trenches in north

The [[Dahr]]-worshiping, half-[[Mihkmari]] town of [[Port Solitude]] is situated on the region's southern coast, as well as [[Tahva]], which straddles two islands in the southwest.

## History

The South Heartwood was originally a large forest similar to the North Heartwood, but with a warmer climate and unique flora, such as banyan trees. In the Second Avihm, the Kingdom of Espinor arose in the east, before becoming an [[Empire of Avsohm|Avsohmic]] governorate as the region was subjugated by the empire.

After [[Fall of Avsohm|Avsohm's fall]] at the end of the Second Avihm, the Kingdom of Espinor regained independence. Some time in the early Third Avihm, Maelihs decided to orchestrate the [[Desolation of the South Heartwood|thorough obliteration of the majority of the South Heartwood]] as a threat and statement of power to all [[Drehmari]], particularly those who were devout to [[Virtuo]]. The boundaries of the target area were drawn, and the Skullbeasts and [[Skullmother]] herself were unleashed and allowed to freely ravage the designated swath of land. This resulted in the slaughter or displacement of the region's entire population, the utter eradication of nearly all of the affected area's dense forest and vegetation, and the permanent aridification (and sometimes scorching) of the soil.

The South Heartwood was resettled by a few groups of people after this calamity, especially pirate communities on the southern coast who took advantage of the region's isolated lawlessness and safety. 

## [[Terminus Network|Terminus]] Tower

The South Heartwood's Terminus tower is located in the desert in the region's east. A small slope of sand leans against its base, allowing access to the first of the protruding beams of red sandstone that are scattered across the tower's eastern side. These beams collectively form a parkour course that can be climbed to the top of the tower. There are no hostile entities present.

| POI | Image | Coordinates | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
| Epicenter of Mael's Desolation |  | X: 1030, Y: 60, Z: 3833 | The epicenter of Mael's Desolation is a vast, pitch-black, scorched crater in the region's middle (east side of the desolated area). Its ground sinks toward its center, where a large, circular shrine made of Skullbeast bones sits. |
| Looted Mining Town |  | X: 1420, Y: 65, Z: 3813 | Directly outside of the epicenter, to the east, is an old, dilapidated Western-style town. Next to the town is a sizable mine with railways, dug into the epicenter crater's rim. The town is now occupied by Mihkmari. This area contains several references to the Red Dead Redemption game franchise; the grave and boots of "Mi'cah Behl" (Micah Bell), two Mihkmari named to "Duhch van dehr Lihnde" and "Dutch van der Lihnd" (Dutch van der Linde) respectively, and a passive Mihkmari named as "Uncle". |
| Port Solitude |  | X: 1870, Y: 67, Z: 4258 | Port Solitude is a small, isolated port town on the region's south coast. Most of its buildings consist of jungle and spruce wood, with red and orange roofs. The town has existed in some form since the Second Avihm, and today it serves as a harbor and pit stop for sailors and pirates. Visitors can shop at the market or pray to [[Dahr]] for safe travels at his church, which has a [devotion](/Story_and_Features/Devotion/) altar. Passive Mihkmari make up half of Port Solitude's residents. |
| Ruins of Espinor |  | X: 2600, Y: 91, Z: 3948 | Espinor was a prominent city located on the region's eastern tip in the Second Avihm and early Third Avihm, and the capital of its own kingdom and Avsohmic semi-autonomous governorate. During Avsohm's reign, a massive bridge was constructed here in order to establish trade, spanning the Strait of Vir and connecting the city to the [Tidal](/Lore/Political_Entities/Tidal_Dynasty/) town of Zovan on the opposite side. Espinor was destroyed during the South Heartwood's ruination, and it now lies in rubble with a partially collapsed bridge. |
| Ruins of Stromnar |  | X: 498, Y: 64, Z: 4038 | Stromnar was an Avsohmic-era city in the eastern South Heartwood with a "strong warrior tradition". It was the birthplace of the military organization [[Blue Exodus]], whose architecture closely resembles that of the city, heavily featuring prismarine (which is an abundant resource in the area and an effective building material) and quartz.|
| Tahva |  | X: 703, Y: 76, Z: 4674 | Tahva is a settlement located on the islands of the southwestern South heartwood |
