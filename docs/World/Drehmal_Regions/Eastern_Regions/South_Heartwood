# South Heartwood

The South Heartwood, also known as [[Maelihs|Mael']] Desolation, is a region in south [[Drehmal (Place)|Drehmal]], an the southern part of the greater Heartwood region. Its has a dry, barren landscape, with deformed terrain and almost no living plant life.

## Geography

The South Heartwood is located in the south coast of Drehmal. The region borders the [[North Heartwood]] to its north, and the Eye of Vir and Strait of Vir to its east. On its west side, an isthmus cuts the Mouth of Drehmal of from the southern ocean and connects to [[Palisades Heath]] and [[Lorahn'Kahl]].

Although most of the region is for the most part scarred, unarable and lacking vegetation, its western isthmus serves as an exception. This land is still heavily forested by dark oak trees, very similar to the North Heartwood. The land to the east of this sustains the most severe damage, most notably the [[Epicenter of Mael's Desolation|epicenter of the desolation]], an enormous, blackened crater. The areas and islands to the south of the epicenter are also partially charred, and a field of many small but deep firey pits sits on its eastern side.
