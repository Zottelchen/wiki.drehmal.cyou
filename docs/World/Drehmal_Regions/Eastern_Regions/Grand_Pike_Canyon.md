# Grand Pike Canyon

![[Grand_Pike_Canyon.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

Grand Pike Canyon is a relatively small region in eastern [[Drehmal (Place)|Drehmal]]. As its name suggests, the region is home to a network of canyons and valleys with forests, lakes and streams.

## Geography

Grand Pike Canyon is nestled between [[Spearhead Forest]] to the south and east and the Nahynaga Mountains to the north and west. On the other side of these mountains are [[Highfall Tundra]] to the northeast, [[Veruhkt Plateau]] to the north, [[Akhlo'Rohma]] to the northwest and [[Purity Peaks]] to the west.

The landscape of Grand Pike Canyon is uniform. The entire region is densely forested with spruce trees, and the terrain is mountainous. The many cliffs exhibit the region's distinct pattern of red and orange with thin stripes of brown, beige and yellow. Several lakes can be found in the lower elevations, fed by streams from surrounding mountains.

There are no settlements in Grand Pike Canyon.

## History

The history of Grand Pike Canyon is for the most part unclear. The earliest known civilization in the region was most likely the town of [[Wokonori]], maybe dating to the early Second Avihm. Its occupants were skillful in manipulating stone, and they were faithful to the earth-related [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) [[Taihgel]], [[Nahyn]] and [[Koh]]. They concerned themselves with mining the sacred stone taihryte deep in the ground.

In the early and mid Second Avihm, the region was likely ruled by the powerful and authoritative [[Empire of Vir]]. 

Grand Pike Canyon was also likely incorporated into the Provinces of Vir in the Third Avihm, which became an early member state of the [[Order of Insohm]] and fought with the loyalists in the [[Insohmic Civil War]]. The large, formidable prison [[Shatterhorn Gulch]] was probably established during this time, in order to hold Insohm's countless prisoners. One extreme example was an inductee into the Insohmic Coven of Potentia who went rogue and had become an uncontrollable necromancer. Even with the Order now mostly dissipated, the prison continues to operate.

## [[Terminus Network|Terminus]] Tower

Grand Pike's Terminus tower is located in the region's north. The majority of the tower is encased in a stepped-cone-shaped stone building, the interior of which contains urns, piles of bones and hostile "Grave Wardens". Two spiral staircases lead from the top of the building to the top of the tower.
