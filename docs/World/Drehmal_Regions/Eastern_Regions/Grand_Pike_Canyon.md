Grand Pike Canyon is a relatively small region in eastern [[Drehmal (Place)|Drehmal]]. As its name suggests, the region is home to a network of canyons and valleys with forests, lakes and streams.

## Geography

Grand Pike Canyon is nestled between [[Spearhead Forest]] to the south and east and the Nahynaga Mountains to the north and west. On the other side of these mountains are [[Highfall Tundra]] to the northeast, [[Veruhkt Plateau]] to the north, [[Akhlo'Rohma]] to the northwest and [[Purity Peaks]] to the west.

The landscape of Grand Pike Canyon is uniform. The entire region is densely forested with spruce trees, and the terrain is mountainous. The many cliffs exhibit the region's distinct pattern of red and orange with thin stripes of brown, beige and yellow. Several lakes can be found in the lower elevations, fed by streams from surrounding mountains.

There are no settlements in Grand Pike Canyon.
