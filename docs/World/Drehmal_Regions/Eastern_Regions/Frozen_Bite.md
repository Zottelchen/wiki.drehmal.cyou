# Frozen Bite

The Frozen Bite is a region in northeastern [[Drehmal (Place)|Drehmal]]. The region consists of a range of tundras, woods, mountains and islands. The name "Frozen Bite" may refer to its mouth-shaped northeastern coast.

## Geography

The Frozen Bite is located in Drehmal's northeast corner. It is separated from [[Faehrcyle]] to the west by a mountain range, and it borders [[Highfall Tundra]] to the south. The region is surrounded by open, iceberg-filled waters on its north and east sides, and the north coast is lined with mountains.

The Frozen Bite's landscape varies greatly. Plants are more common in the east half, with spruce trees being widely present, while the west half is more barren, snowy and rocky. Most of the region's land is extremely flat, with the exception of the mountains in the west and the rocky shores and islands in the east.

**Environmental Sub-Regions:**

- flat, treeless area with ground made of dirt, gravel, clay and concrete in southwest
