The Frozen Bite is a region in northeastern [[Drehmal (Place)|Drehmal]]. The region consists of a range of tundras, woods, mountains and islands. The name "Frozen Bite" may refer to its mouth-shaped northeastern coast.

## Geography

The Frozen Bite is located in Drehmal's northeast corner. It is separated from [[Faehrcyle]] to the west by a mountain range, and it borders [[Highfall Tundra]] to the south. The region is surrounded by open, iceberg-filled waters on its north and east sides, and the north coast is lined with mountains.

The Frozen Bite's landscape varies greatly. Plants are more common in the east half, with spruce trees being widely present, while the west half is more barren, snowy and rocky. Most of the region's land is extremely flat, with the exception of the mountains in the west and the rocky shores and islands in the east.

**Environmental Sub-Regions:**
- flat, treeless area with ground made of gravel and dirt in southwest
- flat area sparsely populated by plants with small pools and streams in south
- large caldera with flat inner ground and acacia and spruce trees in center/east
- rugged shoreline and islands with stone striped with purple, gray and brown in east
- gravelly area with large, floating or semi-floating chunks of snowy, rocky land with icy bottoms in west
- flat, watery area partially covered in snow with no grass and few trees in north

There are no major settlements in the Frozen Bite.

## History

Very little is known about the history of the Frozen Bite. The [[Empire of Vir]] may have expanded into the region in the early/mid Second Avihm, however there isn't enough evidence to confirm. The region has largely consisted of wilderness that has seldom been explored by outsiders, being loosely populated by "barbarians" that the [[Kingdom of Highfall]] wished to keep out of their territory. The environment was likely warmer and more hospitable to flora and fauna before the [[Frostfang Catastrophe]], although its impact on the region was mitigated by the mountains between the Frozen Bite and Faehrcyle.

## [[Terminus Network|Terminus]] Tower

The Frozen Bite's Terminus tower in the region's east, inside of the large caldera. It stands in a large pit with a pool of lava at the bottom, and a parkour course made of floating chunks of ice leads from the edge of the pit to the tower's top. On the side of the pit's bottom is a small, abandoned cabin with a sign reading "Uhl Fahn Gonzo" next to its door. There are no hostile enemies present.
