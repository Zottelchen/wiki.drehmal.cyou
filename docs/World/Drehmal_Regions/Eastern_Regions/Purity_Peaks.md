# Purity Peaks

Purity Peaks is a region in central-east [[Drehmal (Place)|Drehmal]]. The region is littered with pointed white crags, hence its name.

## Geography

Purity Peaks is located between the central plains ([[Capital Valley]] and the [[Gulf of Drehmal]] region) to the west and the Nahynaga mountains to the east, which separates the region from [[Spearhead Forest]]. It also borders [[Akhlo'Rohma]] to the north and the [[North Heartwood]] to the south.

Purity Peaks is recognizable for the isolated pure white crags that can be found scattered throughout the region. Stone of the same color can be found in the region's small cliffs. The landscape consists of plains and woods, the trees being birch and oak, as well as spruce at the base of the mountains in the east. The region is also filled with lakes and rivers.

Purity Peaks is home to the [[Tehrmari|Ro'Tehrmari]] town of Hevhlak in the region's center.

## History

In the Second Avihm, Purity Peaks was known as "Tehrmia", due to the significant number of Tehrmari present in the region. It was mandatory for all La'Tehrmari to make a pilgrimage from their home on the moon [[Lo'Dahr]] to Drehmal, and they would periodically descend from their monastery in the Nahynaga mountains to spend a year with the [[Drehmari]] in the region's many small villages. During this time, [[Wingmakers]] would seek Drehmari who were qualified for ascension to Tehrmari. Tehrmia was incorporated into the [[Empire of Avsohm]], who in their later years constructed the research complex [[Sal'Mevir]] in this region.

Many La'Tehrmari did not enjoy staying on Drehmal, and the [[Scalebound]] eventually made the journey optional. Visits by La'Tehrmari mostly ceased, although the monastery in the mountains continues to be inhabited by priests and a Ro'Tehrmari population still thrives in the region today.

Purity Peak's Terminus tower is located in a small swampy patch in the region's center. Its lower half is ringed by a quartz structure, atop which is a pressure plate that gives the player levitation 5 for 7 seconds, allowing for an easy ascent to the top. There are no hostile entities present.
