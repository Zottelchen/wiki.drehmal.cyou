# Veruhkt Plateau



Veruhkt Plateau is a small region in northeastern [[Overworld|Drehmal]], consisting of woods and elevated plains. As its name suggests, most of the region is encompassed by a large plateau. The name "Veruhkt" refers to the culture that was once present in the region, which drew heavy focus on the moon of [[Lo'Veruhkt]].

## Geography

Veruhkt Plateau is located between the Nahynaga Mountains to the south, separating the region from [[Grand Pike Canyon]], and another mountain range to the north, dividing it from [[Faehrcyle]]. The region also borders [[Akhlo'Rohma]] to the west and [[Highfall Tundra]] to the east.

The region's west is covered in spruce woods with podzol ground, and it lays near sea level. The elevation climbs steeply eastward, forming one side of a plateau. The highlands on the plateau are mostly flat, with grasslands and rocky plains. This area is also home to the Tinaxi Pools, which have vividly-colored red, orange, yellow, green and blue basins. They are also the source of the Resting River, which runs westward through western Veruhkt Plateau and Akhlo'Rohma. The plateau drops off sudenly at a steep cliff on the region's east side, forming the border with Highfall Tundra.

**Environmental Sub-Regions:**
- spruce woods with podzol floor in west and north
- highland plains in east

There are no settlements in Veruhkt Plateau.

## History

In the Second Avihm, Veruhkt Plateau was home to a highly advanced civilization who sought to reach the moon of Lo'Veruhkt, hidden out of sight beneath Drehmal. The Veruhktian people were likely ruled by a centralized political power, based in the capital city of [[Sal'Veruhkt|Verukhaan]]. In an event known by the Verukhtians as the "Desecration", the region was conquered by [[Uffeihl Anyr|Emperor Anyr]] of [[Avsohm]], and its Tech-Priests were massacred, leaving only three alive and in hiding. Verukhaan was renamed to Sal'Veruhkt. 

After [[Fall of Avsohm|Avsohm's demise]], Veruhkt probably regained sovereignty for an indefinite amount of time. Eventually the region came under the rule of the [[Kingdom of Dusps]], who subjected the Veruhktians to harsh oppression and were responsible for the extinction of their culture. 

## [[Terminus Network|Terminus]] Tower

Veruhkt Plateau's Terminus tower is located atop a hill in the region's north. A winding set of wooden stairs and a ladder lead halfway up the tower. No hostile entities are present.

### [[Altar of Insight]]

The Altar of Insight was an ancient stone ziggurat that served as an portant religious site. The Lens of Insight, a device capable of seeing through Drehmal's ground, was held underneath the Alrar, and it was used to locate and observe Lo'Veruhkt. The Altar was devastated and looted by Avsohm during the Desecration.

### Battle Pizzazzle

The Battle Pizzazzle is an ancient Veruhktian tower that was repurposed into a challenge for adventurers by a wealthy man named Vihktor Ohna. The tower has a multitude of stories, each with a small challenge that must be surpassed in order to reach the stairs to the next level. A prize is kept at the top. The business idea was ultimately unsuccessful, as few to none showed up to compete.

### Ruins of Sal'Veruhkt

Sal'Veruhkt, formerly Verukhaan, was the capital city of the Veruhktian state. It was given its newer name after being conquered by Avsohm. It was posssibly destroyed by the Kingdom of Dusps, or it fell into a ruined state as its population was lost under Duspian rule.

### Solitary [[Runic Blacksmith]]

Nearby the region's Terminus tower is a wood-and-stone cabin that houses a lone Runic Blacksmith, positioned at a small, outdoor workshop to the side of the house.
