## In the Lore

Historically, the Veruhkt Plateau has been subject to the influence of their larger neighbors (namely [[Highfall]] and [[Dusps]]). Prior to the [[The Frostfang Catastrophe (book)|Frostfang Catastrophe]], this region was ruled by Highfall. However due to the economic devastation caused by the catastrophe, Highfall did not have enough resources to control the region. It remained a small independent nation until the Kingdom of Dusps invaded and captured it in Av3 200.
