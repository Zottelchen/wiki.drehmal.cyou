# Veruhkt Plateau



Veruhkt Plateau is a small region in northeastern [[Overworld|Drehmal]], consisting of woods and elevated plains. As its name suggests, most of the region is encompassed by a large plateau. The name "Veruhkt" refers to the culture that was once present in the region, which drew heavy focus on the moon of [[Lo'Veruhkt]].

## Geography

Veruhkt Plateau is located between the Nahynaga Mountains to the south, separating the region from [[Grand Pike Canyon]], and another mountain range to the north, dividing it from [[Faehrcyle]]. The region also borders [[Akhlo'Rohma]] to the west and [[Highfall Tundra]] to the east.

The region's west is covered in spruce woods with podzol ground, and it lays near sea level. The elevation climbs steeply eastward, forming one side of a plateau. The highlands on the plateau are mostly flat, with grasslands and rocky plains. This area is also home to the Tinaxi Pools, which have vividly-colored red, orange, yellow, green and blue basins. They are also the source of the Resting River, which runs westward through western Veruhkt Plateau and Akhlo'Rohma. The plateau drops off sudenly at a steep cliff on the region's east side, forming the border with Highfall Tundra.
