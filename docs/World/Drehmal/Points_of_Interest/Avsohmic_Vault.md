## Lore

This chamber is one of the Vaults ordered by the Avsohmic Emperor Ifeihl in Av2 1724 to store pieces of knowledge that were dangerous to the public, such as all information surrounding the Yavhlix facility and Primal Energy. Its access was exclusive to higher ranking members of the Avsohmic government. Later discovered, it was cracked open and its secrets studied by the Order of Insohm. One of its founders, Ultva Utofal, went mad inside the Vault while searching for ancient technology to fight Maelihs and was subsequently lost to nothing.

The Vault is mentioned in three books: [[The White Vault]] found in [[Athrah]], [[Journal of Councilman Kihfs'Mihnar]] found in the [[Insohmic Library]] and [[Av2 1724 - Creation of the Vaults]], which is inside the Vault itself.
