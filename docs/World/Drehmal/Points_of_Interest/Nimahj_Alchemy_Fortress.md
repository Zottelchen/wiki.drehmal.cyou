# Nimahj Alchemy Fortress

The **Nimahj Alchemy Fortress** is a dungeon located in southern [[Nimahj Swamp]], inhabited by alchemists and their guards attempting to progress towards the [[Great Work]].

## Contents

The fortress is inhabited by Witch enemies named "Nimahj Alchemist", as well as Vindicators named "Alchemist's Guard". The main structure has two large towers immediately next to one another. The taller tower holds several small treasures behind chiseled stone bricks around the walls, while the shorter tower has the [[The Great Work]] book, explaining the known history of the [[Great Work]].

The main content is found underground, down a staircase in the main castle. At the bottom of this stairway, players will find a room filled with enemies, including an Evoker. A lever can be flipped in order to start an animation, resulting in the creation of a small structure.

This is one of the [[Gates|quartz gates]] found throughout the world, and is not activated upon its creation.

## Lore

The Alchemy Fortress is inhabited entirely by alchemists and their guards, in an apparent attempt to complete the [[Great Work]]. The construction of the gateway structure seems to have been a significant part of their plan.

Although the alchemists live in Nimahj Swamp, within the [[Empire of Maelihs|domain]] of [[Maelihs]], it seems that they may be working in opposition to the Burnt Lord, as there is a named Nimahj Alchemist imprisoned in the [[Burnt Palace]]. If this is the case, it is likely due to Mael's prior experience with [[Klyhf|Klyhf Him'lahk]].
