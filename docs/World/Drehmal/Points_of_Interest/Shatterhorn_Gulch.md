## Contents

Shatterhorn Gulch is made up of three large towers. The fully gray and black towers contain various loot chests and imprisoned mobs, ranging from [[Maelmari]] to witches and zombie villagers. 

The tallest tower, a mix of gray and black, is where the main attraction is located. This tower holds several hanging cages with strong loot, as well as a large central ladder shaft leading to the upper balcony. Inside of an aventurine (warped) door, a blackstone staircase leads up to a room with the warden's room.

The Shatterhorn Warden is a named zombie with 80 health. When hurt, he can spawn "Maggots" (silverfish), and when killed for the first time, he will drop the [[Festering Strides]] legendary boots. After about 8 seconds, he will respawn in the position that he was killed. There is no way to permanently kill the Shatterhorn Warden. The book in his room, [[Warden's Journal]], explains his situation.

## Lore

It is not officially known how old Shatterhorn Gulch is, but it is known to have existed since at least before the peak of [[Insohm]], in mid-late Av3. During the time of the Order, they used it to store their most dangerous prisoners, including necromancers, pyromancers, and other powerful arcanists.

The most prolific prisoner was a necromancer who staged a prison break, and in this escape, cursed the warden with eternal life and endless festering wounds. It is not clear exactly how long ago this occurred.

Another figure imprisoned at Shatterhorn Gulch is the "fiery maniac" referenced in the Warden's Journal. This has been speculated to be the same person as the subject of the [[Scion's Diary]] book.
