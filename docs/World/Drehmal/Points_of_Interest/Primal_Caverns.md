# Primal Caverns

![[primal_start.png]]

The **Primal Caverns** is a point of interest in northern [[Capital Valley]], and the first major landmark players will see upon emerging to the surface. The term is used to refer both to the set of three mountains just north of the player's [[Stasis Facility|spawn location]], as well as the network of caves beneath the central mountain.

[[Drehmal]], the great serpent deity who built the world thousands of years ago, is said to be asleep deep within the caverns.

Entering the Primal Caverns for the first time grants the "Chamber of Dreams" advancement.

While the lore of this location would suggest that it is home to a vast network of caves and possibly even Drehmal themselves, this is not present in the map itself. Drehmal cannot be found here, and there is only a singular small cave.

## Contents

The Primal Caverns is a very simple structure. Outside, it consists of three mountains resembling the three [Deities](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Deities/): a red mountain in the west, representing [[Maelihs]] and his presence in the west, a blue mountain in the east representing [[Virtuo]], and a taller peak in the center made out of green, representing [[Drehmal]].

A path leads from the gazebo just outside the Stasis Facility directly to the central mountain, lined by braziers. A small lush cave is found inside this hill, containing a few things of note.

A dilapidated shack sits just inside the cavern, holding the [[Journal of a Devotee]] book. At the back of the cavern sits a chest labeled "OFFERINGS TO DREHMAL", containing a stack of ![[snake_compass.gif]]{ width="32" } Snake Ornamented Compasses. These compasses are calibrated to always point to the Primal Caverns.

## Lore

While there is no concrete proof for this assertion, the Primal Caverns' extremely central location within the continent and relevance to Drehmal has led many to suggest that this is where the [[Primal Tree]] stood prior to its [[Felling]] at the end of Av1.

After [[Drehmal]] spent the first decades of Av2 reforming the world, they are rumored to have retired to the Primal Caverns, with the last known sighting of the serpent contained in [[Shorusharoh's Teachings]], the Parable of the Orchard located in [[Drehua Temple]]. In this account, after giving their final lesson to the people, Drehmal slithered away from [[Palisades Heath]] towards the caverns, and is said to have entered a deep hibernation. To this day, Drehmal has not awoken or communicated with the [[Drehmari]] in any way, passing into legend in some parts of the world.

The Primal Caverns were watched over as a sacred place by remaining devotees of Drehmal, particularly the inhabitants of [[Drabyel]] and other small settlements nearby.

### Trivia

At the bottom of the pool near the back of the cave is a hidden room. This room is home to an armor stand with a zombie head, leather pants, and golden boots, dubbed "Jack's Corner" by a sign.
