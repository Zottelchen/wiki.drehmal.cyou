![[drehua.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

**Drehua Temple** is a temple complex located in [[Palisades Heath]], atop a hill in the region's central piece of land. This temple is the location of the [[Devotion]] site for the deity [[Drehmal]], and is home to an order of monks who continue to uphold their teachings thousands of years since their last activity.

Drehua Temple can be accessed by simply following the road south from [[Av'Sal]], just on the other side of the bridge after the Palisades Heath [[Terminus Network#Towers|Tower]], where the path begins to fade away.
