# Teiruun Monastery

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Teiruun Monastery** is a large monastery complex at the northeastern edge of the [[Black Jungle]] region, perched atop the mountain range and overlooking the eastern ocean. The structure is filled with hostile monks and fanatical [[Virtuo]] followers, who were attempting to re-create [[Virmari]] through their own alchemical means, after the Goddess' departure.

Teiruun is a very significant dungeon, housing the [[Pure Corruption]] legendary helmet and several very important lore books, among other features.
