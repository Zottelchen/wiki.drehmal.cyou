# Sepulchral Altar

![[rhaveloth_altar.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

The **Sepulchral Altar** is the [[Devotion]] site for the Burnt Lord, God of Chaos & Corruption, [[Maelihs]]. Located within the [[Maelmari]] city of [[Rhaveloth]], the structure is heavily guarded by some of Mael's strongest devotees, including Ethgar, the Third Burnt General. 

From inside Rhaveloth, the Sepulchral Altar is accessed through a large blackstone door in the face of the mountain, just southeast of the main central road. <br> <br> <br>

Entering the inner sanctum of the Sepulchral Altar for the first time grants the "Rites of Cruelty" advancement.

## Layout

The Sepulchral Altar is a small dungeon, filled with relatively dangerous enemies. Maelmari Brutes outfitted with axes and diamond armor, named "Burnt Templars", can be found throughout the dungeon, including in its large entryway. These mobs deal significant damage, but are relatively slow. Being piglin brutes, they will aggro on players even if they are wearing gold armor. Players must break through one of two large doors (made out of iron bars) in order to progress.

> The central chamber of the Sepulchral Altar.

The door straight ahead opens up to a bridge over the central chamber. Along the western wall, five rooms are home to blazes with the name "Flaming Sentry". The door to the right leads to a hallway around the edge of the central chamber, which has access to each of the five Flaming Sentry rooms. The first path leads down a staircase to the main chamber, where several rows of seats surround a smoking cauldron filled with magma. To the east, a large throne sits over a crimson wood door, presumably for Mael himself to sit on during ceremonies or speeches. Players must dig through this door in order to reach the devotion shrine.

### Shrine Room

The large room to the east of the central chamber is home to Mael's shrine, as well as multiple other noteworthy features. 

This room is guarded by several Maelmari soldiers, including brutes, archers, and Ethgar, the Third Burnt General. Ethgar is a particularly strong Maelmari Brute, carrying a Fire Aspect diamond sword and wearing diamond armor enchanted with Fire Protection. Ethgar has 50 Health (equivalent to 25 hearts), and deals 7 base attack damage. Killing Ethgar will drop the Helmet of the Third General, a player head modeled after Ethgar's helm.

Mael's shrine is found at the northern end of this room, close to Ethgar, and in front of a large basalt organ. At the southern end of the room, a large statue towers over the room, depicting Mael standing over [[Virtuo]] with her eye in his hand. The [[Eyebiter]] legendary shield is located in a trapped chest directly beneath this statue.

Murals along the walls are somewhat difficult to make out exactly, but they appear to depict Maelihs taking over the realm. Two murals toward the north end of the room may depict Mael and Virtuo symbolically being born from the [[Primal Tree]], while six murals at the southern end depict Mael's invasion of the [[Kiln of Virtuo]], his victory over his sister, an image of the [[Burnt Palace]], and the shape of [[Overworld|Drehmal]] in red, indicating a continent fully dominated by Mael.

On the upper levels, multiple side rooms can be found, housing additional enemies and loot, including the area's devotion book, [[Post-Ritual Announcement]]. Chiseled blackstone bricks are used to denote three different locations where tunnels can be dug, creating shortcuts back to the central chamber.

## Maelihs Devotion Guide

Several lower-level devotion offerings to Maelihs are found in invisible item frames throughout the Sepulchral Altar structure, but higher-level offerings must be discovered at other statues of Mael throughout his domain in the west.

Maelihs' domain stretches out across the majority of western Drehmal, and statues of the Chaos God can be found with offerings at their bases in several locations throughout the [[Empire of Maelihs|Empire]]. These locations include [[Ebonrun]], [[Tharxax City]], [[Rhaveloth]], and the [[Hellcrags]], with the offering at the base of the Titan of Strength in the Hellcrags being the only hint containing an adored item.

Like all other devotion sites, a [[Trinkets#Relic Vessel|Relic Vessel]] is found at the Sepulchral Altar. This location's vessel is found above the bridge in the central chamber, in a chest dangling from the ceiling of the cave.
