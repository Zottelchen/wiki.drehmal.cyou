# Xor'Huul

**Xor'Huul** is a ruined settlement on the [[Island of Dawn]]. 

Built in a cave system on the Island of Dawn, Xor'Huul was founded by a tribe exiled from [[Casai]] in mid-Av2, after the founding of the [[Casain Empire]]. The inhabitants came to live on the island until just after the [[Fall of Avsohm]], and were prominent worshippers of [[Koh]], the Aspect of Stone.
