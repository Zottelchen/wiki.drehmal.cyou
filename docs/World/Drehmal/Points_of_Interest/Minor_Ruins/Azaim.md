--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Azaim** is a ruined, abandoned city in northern [[Akhlo'Rohma]]. Settled by migrants from [[Casai]] after the great exodus out of that region due to the [[Dune Wars]], it has a distinct architectural style, and contains remnants of the syncretic Casain-Akhlo'Rohman culture.
