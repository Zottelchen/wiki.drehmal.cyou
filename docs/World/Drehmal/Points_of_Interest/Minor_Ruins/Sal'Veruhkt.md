**Sal'Veruhkt**, formerly known to its Veruhktian founders as **Veruhkaan**, is a ruined city along the southern end of the border between [[Akhlo'Rohma]] and [[Veruhkt Plateau]]. Once the capital city of the highly advanced Veruhktian people, its inhabitants were crushed by military advances from Akhlo'Rohman political forces and eventually the [[Avsohm|Empire of Avsohm]], forcing the natives into hiding and destroying significant parts of the city.
