**Maehrn'Vhos** is a massive wall built at the far northwestern edge of the [[Ebony Veldt]], initially built to repel invaders from [[Casai]] and [[Merijool]] in the north. Today, it is inhabited by [[Mihkmari]] pillagers.

Maehrn'Vhos can be accessed from roads to its north and south: from the north, the road between Merijool and Casai forks off to towards the wall, and to the south, the road trails off into the Ebony Veldt.
