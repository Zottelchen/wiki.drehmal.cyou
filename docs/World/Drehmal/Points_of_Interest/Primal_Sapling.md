# Primal Sapling

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

The **Primal Sapling** is an absolutely colossal tree found inside a jungle caldera, in southeastern [[Merijool]]. Some kind of twisted, perverse remnant of or successor to the original [[Primal Tree]], it is referenced surprisingly infrequently in the map's lore.

The area surrounding the sapling is sometimes referred to as the "Glade of the Giant", from the advancement given upon discovery of the area.

The [[Parenchyma]] legendary chestplate is found here.
