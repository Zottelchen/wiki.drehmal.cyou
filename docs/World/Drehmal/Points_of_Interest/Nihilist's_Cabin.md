# Nihilist's Cabin

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

The **Nihilist's Cabin** is a small structure in the northeastern [[Frozen Bite]], heavily involved in the quest for the [[Oblivion]] mythical weapon. The Compass of Nihility found beneath [[Highfall]] leads here, and the Nihilist's Notes found here lead to [[Mt. Yavhlix]]. The location is also home to multiple notable lore books, concerned with the horrifying forces that destroyed [[Avsohm]].
