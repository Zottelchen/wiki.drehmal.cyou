# Caer Adacia

![[Caer_adacia.webp]]{ align=right width="300" }

**Caer Adacia** was once the largest [[Avsohmic]] city in the [[Ebony Veldt]] [region](/Regions). Only its ruins are visible today, in a savannah in the northeast of the Veldt.

## Lore

Caer Adacia, the city-stronghold, was built between Av2 1000 and 1546. At that time, it was the capital of the [[Tharhan Empire]].

During the [[Dune Wars]], Caer Adacia functioned as the capital of the Avsohmic resistance and withstood a siege for years. It is said that Mael used various siege engines to try to breach the city walls and suffered many casualties. Caer Adacia finally fell in Av3 21, marking the end of the Wars.
