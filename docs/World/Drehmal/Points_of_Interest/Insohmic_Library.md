**The Insohmic Library** (or Old Library Tower) is a ruined tower in the [[Spearhead Forest]] region, located on the eastern coast of [[Mossfield]].

## Lore

After the disappearance of [[Castle Hovadchear]], Mossfield became the capital of the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]], the greatest power of the Third Avihm. This tower was the Insohmic Councilâ€™s Headquarters during that time.
