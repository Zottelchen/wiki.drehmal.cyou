# Insohmic Library

![[Insohmic_library.webp]]{ align=right width="300" }

The **Insohmic Library** (or Old Library Tower) is a ruined tower in the [[Spearhead Forest]] region, located off the eastern coast of [[Mossfield]]. Formerly the headquarters of the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]] in its final days, this relatively small structure is home to the [[Peace Treaty]] legendary weapon.

The library is connected to the ruins of Old Mossfield via a broken bridge.

Discovering this structure for the first time grants the "The Insohmic Library" advancement.

## Contents

After making their way across the broken bridge and entering through the main door, players will find themselves in a tall room with a spiral staircase. The tower is filled with "Old Council Member" enemies, Zombie Villager Librarians holding feathers and books in their hands.

Two books are found on this ground floor: [[Airships of Drehmal]] to the left and [[The Avsohmic Miracle]] in a high bookshelf to the right.

Up the stairs, players will enter a room with the [[Journal of Councilman Kihfs'Mihnar]] book and another ladder up to the very top of the tower, where [[Auxiliary Vahn's Concern]] is found.

From either of these upper rooms, players may spot a balcony to the east with a single trapped chest. This chest holds the [[Peace Treaty]] legendary spear, enchanted with Knockback V.

## Lore

After the disappearance of [[Castle Hovadchear]], Mossfield became the capital of the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]], the greatest power of the Third Avihm. This tower was the Insohmic Councilâ€™s Headquarters during that time.

It is unclear exactly why the enemies in the tower are zombified Council members, or if this has a real lore explanation at all.

## Extras

### Trivia

An AI-less Old Council Member stands on the balcony just below the Peace Treaty chest, specifically designed to be knocked into the ocean.
