# Elvett

![[Elvett.webp]]{ align=right width="300" }

**Elvett** was once an [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] city. Nowadays, only ruins remain, boarding a river in the Western Coast of the [[Ebony Veldt]] [region](/Regions).

## Lore

Elvett was an Avsohmic city attacked by Maelihs during the [[Dune Wars]]. The city resisted more than expected and was not captured until the end of the wars, presumably in Av3 19 or 20.
