# Exodus Citadel

![[exodus_citadel.png]]

The **Exodus Citadel** is a prismarine structure that sits in Lake Nimahj, in the [[Nimahj Swamp]] region. This citadel was once a key [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] facility, but it has largely fallen to ruin in recent years. 

The [[Exodus Vault]], the setting of the 50% network linkage event, is accessed through Exodus Citadel.

## Contents

The Exodus Citadel is a prismarine pyramid-like structure with four main wings. It has minimal content besides loot chests and a few lore books, including [[So Now You Work At The Exodus Citadel! FAQ (Vault)]], which provides an overview of the facility's purpose, as well as [[Blue, Red, and Green]], which explains the relationship between [[Blue Exodus]], [[Red Dawn]], and [[Green Serpent]] as affiliates of Avsohm.

The structure is home to the [[Voidtear Dagger]] legendary weapon, in a chest to the northwest. In version 2.2.2, Voidtear has been reworked and moved to be inside the vault.

At the north end of the citadel, near the holotext terminal, players can drop down a hole to access the [[Exodus Vault]], a main story location.

## Lore

During Avsohmic times, Exodus Citadel sat at the bottom of Lake Nimahj, rather than being on the surface of the lake as it is today. This was a measure taken by its creator, [[Blue Exodus]], to keep it secure from enemy attacks, as it served as the group's initial headquarters. When they partnered with [[Avsohm]], Blue Exodus expanded to build an even more secretive, more secure vault beneath the citadel, making it more of a deterrent than the group's true headquarters.
