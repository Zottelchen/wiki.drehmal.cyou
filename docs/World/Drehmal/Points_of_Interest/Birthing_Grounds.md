# Birthing Grounds

![[birthing_grounds.png]]

The **Birthing Grounds** is a sub-region of [[The Carmine]], southeast of [[Rhaveloth]]. In this area, the ground appears to be made of some kind of flesh, and bizarre "Meat Baby" mobs spawn.

## Contents

The Birthing Grounds takes the form of a valley within the normal terrain of the Carmine, with deeper red blocks replacing the red/orange sand and terracotta found elsewhere in the region. These blocks include Taihryte (netherrack), crucible wart (nether wart) blocks, and carnelian (crimson) nylium. 

Massive bones litter the landscape, sometimes taking familiar shapes such as ribcages, skulls, (clawed) hands, or femurs. These are implied to be the remains of Skullbeasts, many of whom may have been born and died here.

Baby zombies with custom red skins spawn throughout the area, most concentrated around two spawners toward the northern and southern ends. If killed, these mobs have a chance to drop a piece of raw mutton enchanted with Sharpness III.

To the far south, a small gateway leads to a fully intact skull embedded in the cliff face, 13 blocks tall. This skull, if it did belong to a Skullbeast, seems to depict the creatures as similar to a Tyrannosaurus Rex.

This skull contains good loot, but also holds a spawner set to create charged creepers named "Speeder".

### Underground

Near the center of the Birthing Grounds, a swirling growth made up of carnelian (crimson) hyphae and flarepods rises above the ground, and gives way to a small cave network. Following this (mostly linear) cave to its end leads to a wooden structure, with the [[Disciple's Log]] book and the [[Artifacts#Disciple's Greaves|Disciple's Greaves]] artifact.

## Lore

The Birthing Grounds appears to have been a significant resource for the [[Empire of Maelihs]] throughout its history, contributing to the empire's armed forces and food supply. The [[Artisan Items#Rhaveloth|Fleshcoaxer]] artisan item, sold in [[Rhaveloth]], establishes that certain [[Maelmari]], known as "Breeders", are skilled at coaxing tender meat to come to the surface of the Birthing Grounds. A Meat Baby is found in the Meat Shop in Rhaveloth, roasting over an open fire in the basement. It is possible that both the Meat Babies and the fleshy ground itself are sources of the city's mystery meats.

The Birthing Grounds' primary purpose, however, seems to have been the creation of Skullchildren and/or Skullbeasts. The book [[Dahroc's Notes]], found in the [[Burnt Palace]], establishes that the [[Skullmother]] was once kept shackled in the Birthing Grounds, where she was used to create legions of Skullbeasts to fight in [[Maelihs|Mael]]'s wars. The Skullmother was released into the sea by Maelihs in Av3 687.

At some point after the departure of the Mother, a disciple of the Skullbeasts made pilgrimage to the Birthing Grounds, a holy site for one such as himself who worshipped these destructive creatures. Infatuated with a particular Skullbeast named Femura, he attempted to resurrect her by performing a necromantic ritual at the Birthing Grounds, creating the tumor-like mass that leads to the cave below. He was unsuccessful in creating any Skullchildren, but discovered Skullbeast bones deep underground. At this point, he appears to have fashioned the bones into weapons and trinkets, and took a new name to celebrate his devotion. This disciple is almost certainly [[Ossein]], the boss found at the epicenter of Mael's Desolation who wields [[Calamity]], the claw of Femura.
