# Hunter's Crypt

![[hunting_crypt.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

The **Hunter's Crypt** is a small dungeon in northern [[Capital Valley]]/the southern [[Gulf of Drehmal]], and the resting place of three members of the [[Hunting Party]]. An homage to the spawn tomb of previous Drehmal versions, the structure is relatively simple and contains three [[Artifacts]].

The road that runs north and south through western Capital Valley forks off, continuing northwest towards [[Merijool]] and east towards the crypt, which is the easiest way to find the structure. It is built into the cliff face south of this road, behind a small spruce wood door.

## Contents

Behind the door is a spiral staircase which leads down into a stone brick facility, with minable walls on either side. The left side holds loot, while the right side conceals a path further into the structure. Digging through another wall here leads to a hall with murals representing [[Maelihs]] and [[Virtuo]], with a skeleton and zombie spawner.

The end of this short hallway has three walls with chiseled stone bricks, each containing a room with one large coffin. These hold a singular double chest, with one of the three pairs of Artifact-level boots here.

The eastern room holds the [[Artifacts#Boots of the Honorable|Boots of the Honorable]], the southern room the [[Artifacts#Boots of the Scheming|Boots of the Scheming]], and the western room the [[Artifacts#Boots of the Ruthless|Boots of the Ruthless]].

## Trivia

The Hunter's Crypt is a perfect replica of the original Spawn Tomb, the structure in which players started the map in [[Drehmal v2|version 2.0]] and [[Drehmal v21|version 2.1]]. In those versions, players would start in one of the three artifact-containing rooms.

Additionally, the artifacts themselves are references to the light class system which previously existed in v2.0 and v2.1. These boots, in their names and stat bonuses, are identical to the base version of the class boots that players were given at the beginning of the story in those versions. The Boots of the Scheming belonged to the Rogue class, granting movement speed. The Boots of the Ruthless belonged to the Warrior class, granting attack speed. The Boots of the Honorable belonged to the Paladin class, granting maximum health.
