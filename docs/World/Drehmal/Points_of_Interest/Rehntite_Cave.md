--8<-- "under_construction.md"

The **Rehntite Cave** is a massive caverns in the northern mountain range that runs between [[Akhlo'Rohma]] and [[Faehrcyle]], accessed from northwestern Akhlo'Rohma. This cave, the single largest source of [[rehntite]] for [[Avsohm]], was a massive catalyst to the empire's meteoric rise during the reign of [[Drehn|Drehn Mal'Sohm]], but it has met the same fate as most other Avsohmic ruins, becoming largely forgotten by civilization.

The cave is home to the [[Rehntite Plate Mail]] legendary chestplate.
