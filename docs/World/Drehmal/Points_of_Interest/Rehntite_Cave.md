# Rehntite Cave

![[rehntite_cave.png]]

The **Rehntite Cave** is a massive cavern in the northern mountain range that runs between [[Akhlo'Rohma]] and [[Faehrcyle]], accessed from northwestern Akhlo'Rohma. This cave, the single largest source of [[rehntite]] for [[Avsohm]], was a massive catalyst to the empire's meteoric rise during the reign of [[Drehn|Drehn Mal'Sohm]], but it has met the same fate as most other Avsohmic ruins, becoming largely forgotten by civilization.

The cave is home to the [[Rehntite Plate Mail]] legendary chestplate.

Entering the cavern for the first time grants the "The Lost Cavern" advancement.

## Finding the Cavern

The Rehntite Cave is hinted at by the [[Curious Cavern]] book in [[Highfall]], and may also be found naturally through exploration. Its entrance is located in northwestern Akhlo'Rohma, marked by six small quartz pillars just outside an otherwise normal-looking cave.

## Contents

Following this cave leads to a drop, then another tunnel which opens into a massive cavern, whose walls are lined with blue terracotta and prismarine. Strange green terracotta mushrooms, filled with glowstone, grow out of the cave's floor. A traditional High Avsohmic purple/quartz dome sits in the center of the cave, beneath a gigantic orb with an unclear use. 

A bridge leads from the entrance to the main cavern in the south to the central structure, which is filled with Avsohmic sentry units similar to those found at [[Sal'Mevir]]. A levitation elevator in the center of this structure leads to the roof, where a chest containing the [[Rehntite Plate Mail]] legendary item sits.

There are also two other structures behind the main central dome, each containing a lore book. A small platform to the northwest, at ground level, holds the [[A Hard-Won Victory|A Hard-Won Victory?]] book, while the top level of a taller tower to the northeast contains [[Wehndan's Gratitude]].

## Lore

The Rehntite Cave was first discovered by [[Avsohm]], early in the reign of Emperor [[Drehn|Drehn Mal'Sohm]] by the empire's prolific survey drones. The single largest source of [[rehntite]] ever found in the realm, this cavern was one of two massive discoveries (alongside the tear at [[Mt. Yavhlix]]) that spurred Avsohm's meteoric technological growth in the reign of its first emperor.

The Rehntite Cave remained one of the empire's most important locations throughout its entire existence, with live camera feeds monitoring it from other stations and several references to the site. Unfortunately, when [[Fall of Avsohm|the empire fell]], their technique for securely mining the mineral was lost to time. It appears to have been largely untouched since the collapse, but for this reason, it seems that none of the empire's successors would have been able to harness the power of this place.
