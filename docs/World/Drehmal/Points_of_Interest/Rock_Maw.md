# Rock Maw/Epicenter of the Desolation

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

The **Rock Maw**, also known as the **Epicenter of the Desolation**, is the location in the [[South Heartwood]] where the [[Skullmother]] was deployed for the first and only time. This action dropped the equivalent of a massive nuclear bomb on the forest, permanently scorching half of the Heartwood in an instant.

The Rock Maw itself is a massive black mountain, which holds a central arena-like structure of bone blocks. A [[Fervor Stones#Stone of Worry|Stone of Worry]] is found in this area, but its main feature is Drehmal's first accessible open-world boss: [[Ossein]].
