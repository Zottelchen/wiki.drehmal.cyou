# Castle Scarstone

![[castle_scarstone.webp]]{ align=right width="300" }

Castle Scarstone is a ruined castle built primarily of slate, perched on mountains overlooking the [[North Heartwood]] at the point where the Nahynaga and Verdant ranges converge. The ruins are heavily occupied by Mihkmari. A staircase to the right of the entrance leads deep underground into a large, open cavern with step pyramid made of blackstone, atop which sits the legendary weapon One Thousand Scars. This pyramid and sword are one of the few remaining traces of the world in the First Avihm.

## Lore

The castle was built some time in the late Third Avihm by the Order of Insohm as a base of operations during the Battle for Drehmal. After the Order collapsed at the end of the Third Avihm, the castle fell into disrepair. A group of Mihkmari from the nearby Verdant Labyrinth came and looted the ruins, and continue until present-day to occupy the site in search of the rumored secret inside the mountain.


A chest at the top of the blackstone pyramid underneath the castle at **2542, 47, 2154** contains the legendary item [[One Thousand Scars]].
