# Castle Scarstone

Castle Scarstone is a ruined castle built primarily of slate, perched on mountains overlooking the [[North Heartwood]], northeast of [[Gozak]]. The ruins are heavily guarded by [[Mihkmari]].

The castle is home to the [legendary weapon](/Items/Legendary_Items/) [[One Thousand Scars]], as well as an artifact (in certain versions).

## Contents

The castle itself is not massive, containing decent loot across three or four remaining floors. Multiple Mihkmari spawners are found here, and there is a ravager in the building.

On the top floor, at the southwestern corner of the building, a chest with the [[Artifacts#Final Stand|Final Stand]] artifact can be found (on version 2.2.2 only).

### Cavern

A ladder down from an otherwise inconspicuous room in the northwest leads to a room with 6 valuable blocks (3 iron blocks, 2 scale blocks, 1 gold block), with a spiral staircase. This staircase continues downwards for about 170 blocks, eventually opening into a vast, dark cavern.

A massive blackstone pyramid sits in the center of the cave, and a chest at the top of the pyramid holds [[One Thousand Scars]].

There is no other significant content within the cavern, except for connections to surrounding cave networks.

## Lore

It is not clear when the castle atop Mt. Scarstone was first built, but its earliest recorded use was by the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]] as a base of operations during the [[Battle for Drehmal]]. After the Order collapsed at the end of the Third Avihm, the castle fell into disrepair. A group of Mihkmari from the nearby [[Verdant Labyrinth]] looted and settled in the ruins, and continue until present-day to occupy the site.

The lore of the cavern and pyramid beneath the castle are even less clear, but it is explicitly stated that the sword, One Thousand Scars, is extremely ancient. This weapon is one of very few things which are known to have come from the First Avihm, before the [[Felling]].
