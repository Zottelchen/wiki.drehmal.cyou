# Moonlight Sanctum

The **Moonlight Sanctum** is a dungeon in [[Lorahn'Kahl]], located in an aquatic cave beneath the region's large eastern jungle. It can be accessed from three different caves, most prominently near a bridge just west of [[Mohta]].

The Moonlight Sanctum is a relatively challenging combat area, with strong custom skeleton mobs, guardians, and elder guardians making it the closest thing the map has to a vanilla ocean monument. 

Completing this dungeon rewards the player with the [[Ascendance]] mythical weapon.
