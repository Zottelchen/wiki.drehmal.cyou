**The Foundry** is an [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] facility along the border of the [[Anyr'Nogur]] and [[Ebony Veldt]] regions, which served as a center for arms manufacturing and combat training. In-game, the Foundry is a special combat challenge, in which players become enhanced and must defeat 6 waves of highly challenging enemies.

Victory in the Foundry grants access to the lower room, which contains the [[Zenith]] mythical weapon.
