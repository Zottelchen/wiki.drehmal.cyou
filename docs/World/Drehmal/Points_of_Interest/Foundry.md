**The Foundry** is an [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] facility along the border of the [[Anyr'Nogur]] and [[Ebony Veldt]] regions, which served as the empire's center for arms manufacturing and combat training. In-game, the Foundry is a special combat challenge, in which players become enhanced and must defeat 6 waves of highly challenging enemies.

Victory in the Foundry grants access to the lower room, which contains the [[Zenith]] mythical weapon.

The Foundry is located inside of a mountain, but players will likely first discover it through the Foundry bridge, which towers over the settlement of [[Elvett]] and connects the Foundry to [[Mt. Ebonfire]]. 

Reaching the Foundry bridge for the first time will grant the advancement "The Foundry".

## Unlocking the Foundry

The Foundry can be accessed at any time through open-world exploration, but the actual facility at the southern end of the bridge is blocked off by a basalt and bedrock door until its energy relay is back online. To do this, the player must find and flip three levers in the area, all located on side towers that were once connected to the main bridge. These can be activated in any order.

- **Lever 1:** (-3130, 148, 1490) <br>
- **Lever 2:** (-3035, 121, 1186) <br>
- **Lever 3:** (-3394, 145, 1082) 

When all three switches are activated, the basalt Foundry door in the entrance room will open, allowing players to enter into the Foundry proper.

Players are placed into Adventure Mode in the Foundry, and can now progress down into the depths of the facility. Eventually, you will reach a room with four glowing glass chambers and a chest holding the [[The Wondrous Effects of Primal Khivesbrew]] book. Stepping into one of these pods will enhance the player with this Primal Khivesbrew, granting them indefinite Speed II and Jump Boost III status effects. The effects can be removed by exiting and walking back into a pod.

## The Arena

Stepping into the arena for the first time grants the "Rip & Tear!" advancement, and begins the first wave of the combat exercise. Challenging enemies will spawn in six total waves, culminating in a miniboss wave in round 6. Clearing all 6 waves grants the "Supersoldier Certification" advancement, and opens the door on the eastern wall of the room.

At the bottom of this newly opened staircase is a room with [[The Debilitating Side Effects of Primal Khivesbrew]], and more notably, the [[Zenith]] mythical weapon hovering over a pedestal.

After clearing the arena, players can return the way they came, removing their status effects and finding that a new control room has opened up just outside the infusion pods. This control room only has two buttons, each with a different feature: the lower button resets the arena, allowing players to try the challenge again, and the upper button on the wall toggles Infinite Mode, in which players can fight in the arena indefinitely.

A [[Fervor Stones#Stone of Luxury|Stone of Luxury]] appears in an item frame over the upper button in the control room, if the arena is cleared in under 6 minutes.
