# Drehmal Regions

![[Terminus_ceiling.webp]]{ align=right width="300" }

The land of [[Overworld|Drehmal]] is divided into 31 different regions, each of which has distinct terrain features and (with the exception of the Crimson Gorge and Verdant Labyrinth) a [[Terminus Network|Terminus]] tower. Regions can be further subdivided into areas defined by mini-biomes.

In the Terminus, regions are categorized into four groups, each having a corresponding color marked on the ceiling. The groups are [Central](/World/Drehmal/Regions/Central_Regions/) (green), [Western](/World/Drehmal/Regions/Central_Regions/) (red), [Eastern](/World/Drehmal/Regions/Central_Regions/) (blue), and [Outer](/World/Drehmal/Regions/Central_Regions/) (yellow). This wiki follows the same convention.
