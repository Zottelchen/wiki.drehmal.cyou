# Drehmal Regions

![[Terminus_ceiling.webp]]{ align=right width="300" }

The land of Drehmal is divided into 31 different regions, each of which has distinct terrain features and (with the exception of the Crimson Gorge and Verdant Labyrinth) a [[Terminus Network|Terminus]] tower. Regions can be further subdivided into areas defined by mini-biomes.

In the Terminus, regions are categorized into four groups, each having a corresponding color marked on the ceiling. The groups are Central (green), Western (red), Eastern (blue), and Outer (yellow). This wiki follows the same convention.


## Central Regions

 - [[Capital Valley]]
 - [[Gulf of Drehmal]]
 - [[Palisades Heath]]
