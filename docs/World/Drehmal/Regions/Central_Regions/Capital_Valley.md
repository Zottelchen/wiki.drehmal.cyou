# Capital Valley

![[CV_landscape.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

**Capital Valley** is a region in central [[Overworld|Drehmal]], and the first one the player can explore. The region's landscape consists mostly of temperate plains and woods. The name "Capital Valley" dates back to [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] times, when the empire's capital [[Av'Sal]] was located in the west of this region. 

## Geography

Capital Valley encompasses the majority of the **Central Plains (Dreh'Noha)**. The inland sea known as the Mouth of Drehmal to the south gives the region a very short coastline, with [[Palisades Heath]] and the [[North Heartwood]] flanking the sea to the west and east, respectively. To the west, the Burnt Mountains run from north to south, separating Capital Valley from [[North Tharxax]] and the [[Ebony Veldt]]. The region also borders the [[Gulf of Drehmal]] region to the north and [[Purity Peaks]] to the east.

Capital Valley has relatively flat terrain, with some hills and small cliffs. The region is covered in grasslands, with patches of oak and birch trees. Larger terracotta hills in red, blue, and green are also found throughout the region, most notably at the [[Primal Caverns]]. 

**Environmental Sub-Regions:**

- Sparse, tall forests with podzol floor, located both to the south of Av'Sal and in the west along the path towards [[Merijool]]

Capital Valley is home to the town of [[Drabyel|New Drabyel]] on the south coast, the smaller town of [[Solvei]] on the eastern edge of the region, and the very small village of [[Thesund]] at the foothills of the Burnt Mountains to the west. 

## History

Ancient Dreh'Nohan city states were abundant in modern-day Capital Valley in the early days of the Second Avihm. Despite being politically separated, the people of the region shared a common culture. The first polity to unite the region's people was the [[Chosen Kingdom]], originating from Drahbes in the Gulf of Drehmal region, but the kingdom's capital was moved to Drabyel in the far south. 

When [[Drehn|Drehn Mal'Sohm]] inherited the Chosen Throne, he reformed the government and commissioned a new capital city, Av'Sal. The newly born Avsohmic Empire ruled Capital Valley and most of the continent for a few centuries, a time during which quality of life massively improved for [[Drehmari]] due to discoveries in the field of technology. Being the empire's heartland, a severe blow was dealt to the region with the [[Fall of Avsohm|catastrophe]] that ended Avsohm.

Some time in the Third Avihm, the independent towns of Capital Valley (and the Gulf of Drehmal) came together as the [[United Townships of Dreh'Noha]], which became a member state of the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]]. Even after Insohm's fall, this united Dreh'Nohan state continued to exist and does so in the current day.

Worship of [[Drehmal]] is the dominant religion in the region, as it is throughout the central regions of the continent.

## Terminus Towers

![[CV_tower.png]]
> The Capital Valley tower.

Capital Valley's [[Terminus Network#Towers|Terminus tower]] stands in the center of the region, next to the path between the Primal Caverns and the Drabyel Crossroads. It is the easiest tower in the map to climb, having a staircase leading to a ladder directly to the top. There are no hostile entities guarding the tower.

There is also a short Terminus tower on Av'Sal's central island. The area surrounding the tower is inhabited by [[Mihkmari]].

## Points of Interest

### Hunter's Crypt

The Hunter's Crypt is a series of underground stone brick chambers, three of which contain the tombs of members of the hunting party that killed [[Muhs|Greatbeast Muhs]]; Gahwyn the Hunter, Asrihk Clearbrook the Berserker and the Tracker (name unknown). 

The entire structure is a reference to the 2.1 version of Drehmal, in which the [[Stasis Facility]] was replaced by this very crypt, and the player simply awoke inside. The three tombs each contain a pair of boots, which are a reference to the class boots present in that older version of Drehmal.

###  New Drabyel

[[Drabyel|New Drabyel]] is a town sitting on a peninsula on the north coast of the Mouth of Drehmal, and usually the first town to be visited during a playthrough. Its typical buildings take the form of grassy mounds with features of spruce and oak wood. Drabyel was the capital of the Chosen Kingdom in the Second Avihm, and it became a large, crowded city. During the kingdom's transformation into the Empire of Avsohm, the capital was moved to the planned city of Av'Sal. Drabyel was likely almost completely destroyed at the end of the Second Avihm when Avsohm was wiped out, which would be why the modern town is named "*New* Drabyel".

### Primal Caverns

The [[Primal Caverns]] is a small cave beneath a steep green mountain, which sits between a similar red mountain to the west and a blue mountain to the east. These three peaks represent the [three deities](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Deities/). This may be the site where the [[Primal Tree]] stood in the First Avihm. Only a small portion of the actual caverns are accessible (or exist) in-game.

Drehmal is believed to be slumbering deep underneath the Primal Caverns today, having last been seen heading towards the caverns early in Av2.

### Ruins of Av'Sal

[[Av'Sal]] was a massive city which was ordered to be constructed by [[Drehn|Drehn Mal'Sohm]] to serve as the capital of his newly founded [[Avsohm|Avsohmic Empire]]. The majority of Av'Sal is built around a lake, with a central island holding a Terminus tower and the capitol building above the [[Av'Sal Repository|Av'Sal]] (an important [story location](/Story_and_Features/Story_Locations/)). Most of Av'Sal was wrecked when Avsohm fell, and today the ruins are occupied by Mihkmari scavengers.

### Ruins of Ihted

The original name of Ihted is unknown, but its ruins were named by archaeologists after a different city with similarities from the First Avihm. The town, sitting on the east bank of the Noroehl River, predates Avsohm, and it was left completely abandoned during the reign of [[Ifeihl|Emperor Zorhis Ifeihl]] after its inhabitants were exiled for illegally worshiping [[Khive]]. The ancient ziggurat remains there until this day, being frequented by wandering mystics and serving as a [[Devotion|devotion]] site for Khive. The ruins contain passageways and rooms hidden underground.

### Solvei

Solvei is a village lying on a small stream running from one lake to another, near the region's eastern border with [[Purity Peaks]]. Its buildings are built mostly out of spruce, oak and grass.

**Coordinates:** (X: 1559, Y: 75, Z: 800)

### Stasis Facility

The [[Stasis Facility]] is an underground complex near the Primal Caverns that houses 24 Avsohmic stasis pods, acting as the very first [story location](/Story_and_Features/Story_Locations/). The player awakes in one of these pods, and they must escape via a staircase leading to an opening on the surface atop a steep crag. The Stasis Facility has a large, open room with trees to allow the player to gather basic materials after spawning, and a room with murals and signs telling the story of the [[Felling|Felling of the Primal Tree]] and the birth of the three deities.

**Coordinates:** (X: 778, Y: 2, Z: 584)

### Thesund

Thesund is a tiny village perched atop a cliff overlooking a lake below the Burnt Mountains. The settlement only has five buildings, made of wood (spruce and oak) and grass, all surrounding a central square. The village was likely founded shortly after Avsohm's collapse by surviving children.
