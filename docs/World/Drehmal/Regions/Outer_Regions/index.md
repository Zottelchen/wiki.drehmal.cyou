# Outer Regions

The four Outer Regions are located on the outskirts of Drehmal, mostly as outlying islands.

The **[[Island of Dawn]]** and **[[Island of Dusk]]** are large isles located to the far northwest of the continent, dominated by crystal formations and vibrant purple grass.

The island of **[[Sahd]]** is located to the far southeast, off the coast of the [[Black Jungle]], known for its lush pink trees.

**[[Mt. Yavhlix]]** is the only non-island region in this category, attached to the northwestern coast of [[Faehrcyle]] in the frozen north.
