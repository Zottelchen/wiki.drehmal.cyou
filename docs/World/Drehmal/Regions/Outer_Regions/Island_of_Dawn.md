# Island of Dawn

![[DW_landscape.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

The **Island of Dawn** is an island region, recognizable by its vibrant pink and purple colors. It is located in [[Overworld|Drehmal's]] far northwest, to the east of its darker counterpart, the [[Island of Dusk]].

## Geography

The Island of Dawn is located in the northwestern ocean, in close proximity to the Island of Dusk, which lies across a narrow strait to the west. The island is located north of [[Merijool]] and west of [[Mt. Yavhlix]].

The region's terrain is made up mostly of hilly grasslands, sparsely populated with pink-leafed oak trees. The occasional patch of mycelium with giant mushrooms is also present. The island is home to many pink and purple rocks and cliffs, the latter largely being displayed on the sides of a tall but thin plateau in the region's western half. The island is ringed by sand beaches.

There are no major settlements on the Island of Dawn.

## History

It is suggested that the Island of Dawn remained uninhabited until the mid-Second Avihm, when the [[Casai|Casain]] Xorha clan was captured and sent on a northeast trajectory into what was believed to be empty ocean. The survivors washed up on the Island of Dawn and, driven by their worship of the [Aspect](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) of Stone, [[Koh]], established the subterranean dwelling of [[Xor'Huul]].

The [[Avsohm|Avsohmic Empire]] later discovered and took control of the island. The mendarum crystals that are found exclusively on the Islands of Dusk and Dawn were essential for carving runes into [[rehntite]], being the only materials powerful enough to carve rehntite. Despite the mining activity that took place in the region, Avsohm never encountered or knew of Xor'Huul, and possibly vice versa. Xor'Huul's population was wiped out by a plague and civil conflict caused by a failed ritual only one year after [[Fall of Avsohm|Avsohm's mysterious ending]]. The island once again fell into obscurity.

It wasn't until Av3 298 that the Island of Dawn was rediscovered. It once again came into use as a source of mendarum crystals, this time for the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]]. Dawnspire Bastion, a [[Virmari]] fortress, was also built high up on the island. The mines and docks constructed in the region were abandoned as [[Virtuo]] disappeared and the Order dissolved, but the occupants of Dawnspire Bastion tried to hold on to their lifestyle and faith.

The Virmari were losing hope at the start of the Fourth Avihm, and many left the Bastion. [[Rihelma]] appeared to the forsaken warriors in a moment of dire need, and they found new meaning by worshiping her. Dawnspire Bastion became known as "Star-Rise Bastion". However, they had the misfortune of being abandoned yet again when Rihelma permanently fled to [[Lo'Veruhkt]] in the coming decades.

## Terminus Tower

> The Island of Dawn tower.

The Island of Dawn's [[Terminus Network#Towers|Terminus tower]] is located in the region's center, north of an inlet. One giant mushroom grows right next to it and another grows on top. Many more smaller but still player-sized mushrooms grow around the tower's base and out of its sides. The assortment of mushroom caps and roots lining the tower forms a parkour course that provides access to the top. There are no hostile entities present.

A custom mooshroom named "Kayleigh" stands on the very top of the tower's highest mushroom.

## Points of Interest

### Star-Rise Bastion

[[Star-Rise Bastion]], originally called "Dawnspire Bastion", is a pink, purple, and blue fortress mounted high up on a crag in the island's east. It is home to a group of [[Virmari]] who have devoted their lives to Rihelma in Virtuo's absence. As such, Rihelma's [[Devotion|devotion]] altar can be found within. Starrise Bastion's Virmari occupants are hostile to the player.

### Xor'Huul

[[Xor'Huul]] was an ancient settlement built underground, beneath the island's large plateau. The settlement was founded by members of Clan Xorha, a clan from northern [[Casai]] who was exiled after killing [[Athrah Zarha]] in Av2 1256. The survivors washed ashore on the Island of Dawn, and built their new city-state inside of the island's cave systems. Today, the city lies in ruin, over a thousand years after the city fell to a plague.

## Extras

### Trivia

The Island of Dawn was the access point for the end-game [[Court of Nothing]] sequence in [[Drehmal v21|version 2.1]], which has since been moved. The now-unused portal for this sequence can still be found deep inside of the large mountain in the western portion of the island.

***

The small portal structure in the southwest of the Island of Dawn, reminiscent of portals from the Botania mod, does not function. In previous versions, it was accompanied by a lore book establishing that it was intended to take its creator to [[Xivrhynt]].
