# Island of Dawn

![[Islandofdawn.webp]]{ align=right width="300" }

The **Island of Dawn** is an island region distinctive for its vibrant pink and purple colors. It is located in [[Overworld|Drehmal's]] far northwest, to the east of its darker counterpart, the [[Island of Dusk]].

## Geography

The Island of Dawn is located in the northwestern ocean, in close proximity to the Island of Dusk, which lies across a narrow strait to the west. The island is located north of [[Merijool]] and west of [[Mt. Yavhlix]].

The region's terrain is made up mostly of hilly grasslands, sparsely populated with pink-leafed oak trees. The occasional patch of mycelium with giant mushrooms is also present. The island is home to many pink and purple rocks and cliffs, the latter largely being displayed on the sides of a tall but thin plateau in the region's western half. The island is ringed by sand beaches.

There are no major settlements on the Island of Dawn.

## History

The lore suggests that the Island of Dawn remained uninhabited until the mid-Second Avihm, when the [[Casai|Casain]] Xorha clan was captured and sent on a northeast trajectory into what was believed to be empty ocean. The survivors washed up on the Island of Dawn and, driven by their worship of the [Aspect](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) [[Koh]], established the subterranean dwelling of Xor'huul.

The [[Avsohm|Avsohmic Empire]] later discovered and took control of the island. The mendarum crystals that are found uniquely on the Islands of Dusk and Dawn were essential for carving [[Arcanism|runes]] into rehnite. Despite the mining activity that took place in the region, Avsohm never encountered or knew of Xor'huul, and possibly vice versa. Xor'huul's population was wiped out by a plague caused by a failed ritual only one year after [[Fall of Avsohm|Avsohm's mysterious ending]]. The island once again fell into obscurity.

It wasn't until Av3 298 that the Island of Dawn was rediscovered. It once again came into use as a source of mendarum crystals, this time for the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]]. Dawnspire Bastion, a [[Virmari]] fortress, was also built high up on the island. The mines and docks constructed in the region were abandoned as [[Virtuo]] disappeared and the Order dissolved, but the occupants of Dawnspire Bastion tried to hold on to their lifestyle and faith.

The Virmari were losing hope at the start of the Fourth Avihm, and many left the Bastion. [[Rihelma]] appeared to the forsaken warriors in a moment of dire need, and they found new meaning by worshiping her. Dawnspire Bastion became known as "[[Starrise Bastion]]". However, they had the misfortune of being abandoned yet again when Rihelma permanently fled to [[Lo'Veruhkt]] a century later.

## [[Terminus Network|Terminus Tower]]

The Island of Dawn's Terminus tower is located in the region's center, north of an inlet. One giant mushroom grows right next to it and another grows on top. Many more smaller but still player-sized mushrooms grow around the tower's base and out of its sides. The assortment of mushroom caps and roots lining the tower forms a parkour course that provides access to the top. There are no hostile entities present.

## Points of Interest

### Starrise Bastion

Starrise Bastion, originally called "Dawnspire Bastion" as told by the lore, is a pink, purple, and blue fortress mounted high up on a crag in the island's east. It is home to a group of Virmari who have devoted their lives to Rihelma in Virtuo's absence. As such, Rihelma's [[Devotion|devotion]] altar can be found within. Starrise Bastion's Virmari occupants are hostile to the player.

### Xor'huul

Xor'huul was an ancient settlement built underground, beneath the island's large plateau. After Clan Xorha in northern Casai killed the emperor Athrah Zahra in battle, every member was shackled to ships and set out to sail in the ocean to the north. Those who survived landed on the unknown Isle of Dawn, and they moved underground for an environment that was more familiar and sacred to their Koh-based religion. This is the origin of Xor'huul. Settlers encountered the native crystal mites (referred to by them as "Vorthrah"), who they believed to be the spiritual guardians of the land's mendarum crystals. Ritual sacrifices were performed in return for the right to live in the caverns and harness the crystals' magic. The ruling class in this settlement's society consisted of nobles, priests, and a king. After centuries of the civilization's peaceful existence, a priest attempted to perform a ritual using instructions in a tome from the Coven of Koh in the Island of Dusk, in hopes of coverting themself into an ascended Kohmari. It instead cursed the practitioner to suffer from a deadly disease that caused the victim to slowly be covered with stone and gems. The plague turned out to be contagious, and it spread to the other priests, probably the nobles, and the king. The death of the priests and the nobles' and king's seclusion and food-hoarding caused Xor'huul's society to be upended, and every Xorhai person was most likely killed by the disease. The well-preserved ruins of Xor'huul can still be found today via an entrance at the large plateau's southern base.
