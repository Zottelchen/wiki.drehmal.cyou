# Sahd

![[Sahdisland1.webp]]{ align=right width="300" }

**Sahd** is an island region in [[Overworld|Drehmal's]] southeastern ocean. It doesn't appear on the map sold by [[Adventuring Merchant|Adventuring Merchants]] and its existence is scarcely hinted to in other parts of the world, making it a difficult discovery for the player to make.

## Geography

Sahd is located in the ocean to the south of the Black Jungle. No other region is moderately close to it. The southernmost point of land in Drehmal can be found in Sahd.

The island can be divided into four rough sub-regions: the white mountains in the north, the Seha Highlands in the east, the purple mountains in the southeast, and the swamp in the south. The steep mountains in the north are made up of white stone, and the surrounding areas below them are home to patches of cherry blossom (acacia) trees. The Seha Highlands on the island's east side are located atop a plateau with purple and pink cliffs and are populated by sparsely scattered cherry blossom trees. It is named after the Seha River, which runs from a small lake in the highlands down into the eastern ocean. The lower grounds to the west have a few more cherry blossom trees as well as regular oaks. On the eastern side are dense oak woods. Between the Seha Islands/central plains and the southern swamp is a small mountainous zone also characterized by purple and pink stone. The Ohgai River flows from an inland lake in this area into a bay in the west. The large swamp in the south consists of dense oak woods covering a homogenous mix of low-lying land and shallow waters.

**Environmental Sub-Regions:**

- White mountains in north
- Flat Seha Highlands with cherry blossoms (acacia) in east
- Purple and pink mountains in southeast
- Oak swamp with podzol in south

The city of [[New Sahd]] is located by the bay in the west, at the mouth of the Ohgai river. The town of [[Morah]] is situated up in the northern mountains.

## History

Sahd's ancient history is unknown, but by some time in the mid-Second Avihm, the region's people were divided into [[Sahdan Clans|three clans]]: the Dahe in the north, the Zedoh in the east, and the Osaigah in the south. These clans clashed with each other, culminating in a tragic battle at Mt. Narukin in which all sides were massacred. This destroyed the system of clans.

The state of the region after this is unclear, but Sahd was likely divided into several different kingdoms. However, it is known with certainty that the island was overrun by criminals. Sahdan prisoners began being deported to the Black Jungle immediately after the [[Empire of Vir]] fell. 

In the late Second Avihm, a Sahdan king sent envoys to the Black Jungle to negotiate an alliance with the [[Tidal Dynasty]]. They were attacked on sight by order of the [[Tide Queen]], who held a grudge for the rampant outlaws that had been carelessly discarded onto their land centuries ago. The Tide Queen enacts vengeance by cutting off Sahd from the rest of Drehmal, making sure it is forgotten by all outsiders.

Sahd appears to have experienced an isolated yet peaceful history throughout the Third Avihm and into the Fourth. Although the Tidal Dynasty is long gone, the island has yet to be rediscovered by mainlanders. The region's political organization remains unexplained.

## [[Terminus Network|Terminus Tower]]

Sahd's Terminus tower is located in the Seha Highlands, directly next to a shorter pagoda. A row of floating platforms suspended by balloons forms a bridge between this structure's highest floor and the top leaves of a cherry blossom tree that stands in front of the tower. On the far side of the treetop, a ladder leads up to a couple of small wooden platforms attached to the side of the Terminus tower at its midpoint. There are no hostile entities present.

## Points of Interest

### Cursed Estate

In the island's southeast is a large, abandoned estate consisting of a grand mansion and a smaller tower, both built primarily from dark oak wood and quartz. Long ago, it belonged to an unknown but powerful person who owned a special artifact. This drew the attention of an army of bandits, who attacked the estate. The owner, who later was presumably killed, laid a curse that forever bound any intruders to the mansion as anguished spirits. These hostile "___" roam the halls to this day.

### Dahe Clan Ruins

The Dahe Clan was one of Sahd's three ancient clans. All that remains is a small cluster of faint stone ruins under a grove of cherry blossom trees in the region's northwest.

### Morah

Morah is a small village nestled in Sahd's northern mountains, accessed by a path leading up from the coastal plains below. Its buildings are primarily made of different types of wood. A large house standing apart from the rest of the village serves as a residence of the [Apsect](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) [[Mari]]. 

### New Sahd

New Sahd is a port city on the island's west coast, built mostly of quartz, dark oak, and acacia wood. Its buildings are spaced out and connected by brick paths surrounded by patches of wheat. New Sahd's origin is unknown, but its name indicates that it may be the successor to an older settlement named "Sahd", like the island as a whole. If the region is politically united or ever has been in recent times, New Sahd would certainly be the capital.

### Osaigah Clan Ruins

The Osaigah Clan was one of Sahd's three ancient clans. All that remains is a small cluster of faint stone ruins below the cursed estate in the region's southeastern mountains, accompanied by a standing torii and a small building containing "[[An Elegy to Pain]]".

### Zedoh Clan Ruins

The Zedoh Clan was one of Sahd's three ancient clans. All that remains is a cluster of ruins on the banks of the Seha River in the island's northeast, consisting of various types of stone.
