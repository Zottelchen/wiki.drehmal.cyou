# The Carmine

![[TC_landscape.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

**The Carmine** is a region in southwestern [[Overworld|Drehmal]]. Its landscape is distinctive for its vast, red and orange sands and lava lakes. These vivid colors are also the origin of the region's name; "carmine" is a deep red dye.

## Geography

The Carmine is located in Drehmal's far southwest. The [[Crimson Gorge]] stands between the region and the [[Hellcrags]] even further southwest. A large gulf to the north separates the Carmine from [[Anyr'Nogur]], and a narrow land bridge connects the two sides at its mouth. The region directly borders [[Lorahn'Kahl]] to the east and [[South Tharxax]] to the northeast. Ocean lays to the west and south.

The majority of the region consists of a red and orange desert littered with bare trees and giant bones, presumably belonging to [[Skullbeasts]]. The landscape here sports cliffs with red, orange, and yellow stripes, particularly on the shores. Red crags and small stone pits can also be found scattered around. A giant lava lake shaped somewhat like an "L" rotated 180 degrees forms the region's eastern border and also the boundary between the large desert and a smaller grassland section in the northeast (which is still devoid of leaf-bearing trees).

The [[Maelmari]] city of [[Rhaveloth]] is located on the region's southwestern edge, at the entrance to the Crimson Gorge.

## History

For nearly all of history since the beginning of the Second Avihm, the Carmine has been part of [[Maelihs|Maelihs's]] [[Empire of Maelihs|domain]]. It was likely initially populated with [[Maelmari]] during the [[Deity War]].

Toward the end of the Second Avihm, The [[Avsohm|Avsohmic Empire]] built up sturdy lines of defense on their border with Maelihs's empire. Around the same time, land in the Carmine (the Birthing Grounds) was also being used to experiment with and raise Skullbeasts. [[Fall of Avsohm|Avsohm's downfall]] meant Maelihs was finally able to expand his borders at the start of the Third Avihm.

The Carmine became the core of the newly grown empire. Later in the Avihm, the [[Insohm|Insohmic Coalition's]] success in the [[Battle for Drehmal]] carried their front lines into the Carmine, finally disrupting over two thousand years of complete, continuous control by Maelihs. However, the Order of Insohm soon collapsed, likely before the Coalition was able to push all the way to the Crimson Gorge. The armies quickly retreated or were driven out. Maelihs's administration retains its firm grip on the region into the present day.

## Terminus Tower

> The Carmine's Terminus tower.

The Carmine's [[Terminus Network#Towers|Terminus tower]] is situated on a tiny island in a lava lake in the region's center. Its bottom half is encased in a solid, red brick tower. Four matching but slightly smaller towers surround it, one in each cardinal direction. A blaze spawner is placed on the eastern one, and three blazes stand guard on top of each of the other ones. The roof of each of these towers is linked to the top of the central brick tower by a staircase. All of them are also solid, except the western one. A red brick bridge stretches from the west shore of the lake to an entrance in the west tower's middle, and from there a stairwell leads to the roof of this tower.

## Points of Interest

### Birthing Grounds

The [[Birthing Grounds]] are an area of land nestled between mountains in the southern Carmine, containing the remnants of countless large creatures. It was used by Maelihs as designated nesting grounds for the [[Skullmother]], where she was used to create [[Skullbeasts]].

### Rhaveloth

[[Rhaveloth]] is a Maelmari-inhabited metropolis at the the threshold of the Crimson Gorge, protected by a large wooden wall. Its architecture utilizes a combination of spruce, dark oak, slate, blackstone, and carnelian wood and bricks. The city likely originated from around the time when Maelihs first started converting Drehmari into Maelmari, and ever since it has been the principal center of population for educated, civilian members of the race.

### Maelmari Lookout

A large Maelmari lookout tower is hidden in a valley near the southern coast, home to the [[Artifacts#Lookout Legwear|Lookout Legwear]] artifact.

### Maelmari Town Ruins

In the northwest corner of the region, by the land bridge between the Carmine and Anyr'Nogur, charred blackstone/spruce wood rubble can be found. The town that once stood on this site was presumably inhabited by Maelmari, and a book here implies that it once experienced relative economic prosperity. The reason for its demise is unknown.
