# South Tharxax

![[ST_landscape.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

**South Tharxax** is a region in western [[Overworld|Drehmal]]. It constitutes the southern part of the broader Tharxax Plains, whose name is derived from a [[Maelmari]] corruption of "Tharhan", the ancient name for the local land and people.

## Geography

South Tharxax is located between the River Salah to the west and the Burnt Mountains to the east, which form the region's boundaries with [[Nimahj Swamp]] and [[Palisades Heath]] respectively. The region blends into [[North Tharxax]] to the north. It also borders [[Lorahn'Kahl]] to the southeast, [[The Carmine|the Carmine]] to the southwest, and the inland Tharxax Sea to the west.

South Tharxax's climate is temperate, with a landscape made up of grasslands and oak and spruce woods. Many lakes and rivers can be found in the region as well, along with tall plateaus with brown-and-orange striped cliffs. A few vibrant, red-orange rocks are scattered around the northwest. The region's riverbanks and shorelines have sand beaches.

**Environmental Sub-Regions:**

- [[Slime Island]] in southeast, surrounded by thin, brown-and-orange striped ridge <br>
- Grassland area in south riddled with small, stone-covered craters <br>
- Burnt, dying plains in the southwest, along the lava lake border with The Carmine

[[Tharxax City]] is located on the tip of a peninsula protruding into the gulf west of South Tharxax.

## History

The fertile lands along the River Salah were settled at the beginning of the Second Avihm by survivors of the [[Felling]], one of the first places where civilization was able to recover in Av2. Tribes and then kingdoms were formed, and eventually, power was consolidated in the city of Elthun (the site of modern Tharxax City), from which the [[First Tharhan Empire]] ruled. This empire supported [[Maelihs]] in the [[Deity War]] to discourage any invasion. The First Tharhan Empire dissolved from internal problems in due time, giving way to [[Six Tharhan Kingdoms|six new kingdoms]]. South Tharxax was divided between the kingdoms of Erxsival, Salahnar, Loraga, and possibly Nimahj.

When the [[Casain Empire]] staged an attack on the combined Tharhan kingdoms, forces from [[Caer Adacia]] to the north caught all parties off guard and took control of the land (the [[War of Unification]]). The [[Second Tharhan Empire]] reigned over South Tharxax and adjacent regions for roughly a couple centuries, before it was handed to the rapidly growing [[Avsohm|Empire of Avsohm]]. The southern portion of the region (Erxsival and Salahnar) was allotted to the provincial authority of House Anyr, based in [[Sal'Anyr]], and the northern portion (Loraga and maybe Nimahj) was granted to House Silar, based in [[Fort Nimahj]]. The Tharhan people were put to work on farms for the empire, and new technology was introduced.

Following [[Fall of Avsohm|Avsohm's spontaneous collapse]], there was a wave of resentment for all things Avsohmic in Tharhan. The region was soon engulfed in [[Empire of Maelihs|Maelihs's growing empire]] as his armies fought their way north in the [[Dune Wars]]. Elthun, now "Tharxax City", was subjected to heavy taxation and its residents faced the constant threat of being arrested and sent to [[Rhaveloth]]. The same could probably be said for [[Semehol]], a town based around an industry of harvesting and processing slime from the nearby Slime Island. The local workers unsuccessfully rebelled, and the town was destroyed and its people were massacred. 

The [[Insohm|Insohmic Coalition]] liberated South Tharxax during the [[Battle for Drehmal]], capturing Tharxax City after a siege. The region was likely annexed by one or more fighting members of the Order of Insohm. Before long, however, the Order fell apart, and Maelihs swiftly regained control of the region and surrounding areas. South Tharxax remains subjugated by his empire into the present day.

## Terminus Tower

> The South Tharxax tower.

South Tharxax's [[Terminus Network#Towers|Terminus tower]] is located on a small island in the water to the west of Tharxax City. A path leads from a dock on the east side of the island to the base of the tower in the west. Around the tower are the ruins of three small, wooden buildings. The tower itself is considerably short, and a narrow wooden bridge spans from elevated ground nearby to the tower's midsection. A ladder leading to the top dangles over the bridge, out of reach. There are no hostile entities present.

## Points of Interest

### Loraga Keep

[[Loraga Keep]] is a mostly-abandoned castle and palace situated on a plateau in the region's north. It was most likely built under the kingdom of Loraga in the mid-Second Avihm. Its residents seemingly acquired strange seeds and planted them inside of wounds, causing plants to grow within them and driving them insane. The only current survivor is the hostile "Infected King", who stands at the top of a tower. 

There is significant loot to be found here, including a [[Fervor Stones#Stone of Luxury|Stone of Luxury]].

### Ruins of Semehol

[[Semehol]] was a town in the region's south, located between Tharxax City and the Slime Island. The primary occupation of its inhabitants was refining slime harvested from the Slime Island. During Maelihs's occupation, the population revolted against their main oppressor, the [[Burnt Generals|Burnt General]] Ethgar. They ultimately failed. They were slaughtered in masses and the town was razed to the ground. Semehol still lays in ruins roamed by Maelmari soldiers. The [[Artifacts#Sliming Trousers|Sliming Trousers]] artifact is located here.

### Slime Island

[[Slime Island]] is an island encircled by a waterway in the region's southeast, just west of the Burnt Mountains. The island and waterway is surrounded by a brown-and-orange striped ridge on its other three sides. The island itself is composed of moss, lime concrete, green and lime terracotta, and most prominently, slime blocks. The [[Artifacts#Slime Chrysalis|Slime Chrysalis]] artifact is found here.

### Tharxax City

[[Tharxax City]] is a large, industrial city on the region's southwest coast. It is characterized by its brick streets and buildings made of stone, spruce wood, and brick. The city is ancient; it was established in the early Second Avihm as Elthun, and it was the capital of the First Tharhan Empire. It was likely later also the capital of the kingdom of Erxsival, and it served as the location for the ceremonial coronation of Tiderra I, the Second Tharhan Empire's first empress. The city was then ruled by Avsohm, before being seized by Maelihs. This is when the city was endowed with its current name. Maelihs was unpopular in Tharxax City for his exorbitant tax rates and restrictive policies. Insohm's takeover during the Battle for Drehmal was welcomed, and the city probably played an important role in supporting the alliance's industries. However, the Insohmic Coalition soon fell apart and Maelihs was quick to reassert his control over the city. Authority in Tharxax City is held by the the Lord Magister, a member of Maelihs's administration.
