# Merijool

![[Merijool1.webp]]{ align=right width="300" }

**Merijool** is a region in northwestern [[Overworld|Drehmal]]. Its landscape is made up of temperate woods with autumn-colored leaves.

## Geography

Merijool is located on the north coast of the continent, forming the west shore of the Gulf of Drehmal. The region borders the [[Gulf of Drehmal]] region to the southeast, [[Casai]] to the west (although the Zephyr Sound occupies a lot of space between the two regions), and [[Mt. Ebonfire]] and the [[Ebony Veldt]] to the southwest. A horizontal segment of the Burnt Mountains divides the region from more of the Ebony Veldt to the south.

Merijool is split into an east and west half by a vertical river flowing into the northern ocean. Despite this, the two sides differ mainly in lore, and the region's overall landscape is mostly uniform. The region is populated with oak and birch woods with bright, red leaves, patches of giant mushrooms, grasslands, lakes, and bluffs with orange cliffs. Standing out in contrast to the usual terrain is the land surrounding the [[Primal Sapling]] in the south, which is characterized by red, orange and yellow mountains and a small jungle-like biome.

**Environmental Sub-Regions:**
- Mt. Mekta (snowy) in northeast
- Area around Primal Sapling in south with small mountains and jungle

On the south edge of a lake in southern Merijool (the source of the region's central river) is the town of [[Okeke]].

## History

Like many other northern regions, Merijool once had a much different environment and climate. It was initially a jungle, similar to [[Lorahn'Kahl]] and the [[Black Jungle]]. In the early Second Avihm, Merijool was inhabited by many "Merian" tribes. From the very beginning, there has been a cultural distinction and rivalry between the east and west. The Merians came to be predominantly faithful to [[Loe]] in the east and [[Lai]] in the west. Known examples of eastern Loe-supporters were the Mekta tribe and the people of the town of Kamt. At some point, some of the tribes (most likely those in the east only) were united under a Grand Council based at Arijoor Forks. It is unclear how long this union lasted. 

In the Av2 1400s, the [[Casian Empire]] launched an attack on western Merijool with the intent of eastward expansion. Although the region's peoples were still disorganized, they were able to band together, and, using [[Arcanism|arcanism]], successfully ward off the invaders. This conflict is known as the Zephyr War. Some time later, the Kingdom of Western Merijool was established, officially unifying the western tribes. Western Merijool would develop a peaceful relationship with the [[Second Tharhan Empire]] after it was founded centuries later.

Merijool, along with the majority of the West, was subsumed under the [[Avsohm|Empire of Avsohm]], probably through nonviolent negotiations. Avsohm appears to have had little direct impact on the region. However, the [[Frostfang Catastrophe]] that took place at this time (due to the affairs of Avsohm) permanently altered its environment, transforming the climate from tropical to temperate. These drastic and adverse effects posed a major challenge to the region's people, since they had to adapt to a completely new environment and some elements of their old culture were lost.

After [[Fall of Avsohm|the empire's fall]], the region was presumably attacked by the forces of [[Maelihs]]. However, it is not known if they succeeded in conquering the region for a short period of time. Some time in the Third Avihm, Merijool fully united under the officially secular Republic of Merijool. This polity became a later member of the [[Insohm|Insohmic Council]], and as such, they participated in the [[Battle for Drehmal]], possibly earning additional territory. The Republic of Merijool continued to stay intact after the crumbling of the Order of Insohm, and it governs the region today.

Merijool's Terminus tower is located on a hilltop in the region's middle, to the west of the central river. Most of it is encased in a wood-and-stone tower mill-like structure with stairs and ladders leading up its sides to a small platform at the top. The structure is guarded by undead enemies.

## Points of Interest

### Arijoor Forks

Arijoor Forks is a group of solid, grass-topped stone structures in mid-eastern Merijool. It has two separated parts: the western part has structures with many right angles, while the eastern part has mostly circular structures. Arijoor Forks was the meeting place of the Grand Council that governed the people of east Merijool at some point in the Second Avihm.

### ICS Arbiter

The [[ICS Arbiter]] is a large airship and the the head of the Insohmic fleet. It once served as a military vessel and its conference room was used by the Insohmic Council. With the Order having mostly fallen apart, the ship now hosts loyalists wishing to continue to carry out Insohm's missions and possibly restore it to its former glory. The ship is currently positioned over the northeast coast of Merijool.

### Maerhn'Vhos

[[Maehrn'Vhos]], dubbed the "Great Wall of the West", is a towering, ornately carved stone wall, situated on the border between southwestern Merijool and the Ebony Veldt. A road runs through a gap in its center. It was originally built by the Second Tharhan Empire to ensure safety from the Casain Empire and West Merijool to the north. Today, the wall is used as a [[Mihkmari]] checkpoint.

### Okeke

Okeke is a small town in southern Merijool that is built across a stream feeding into a lake. Its buildings are contiguous and composed mostly of stone and spruce wood, having flat roofs with parapets, giving a castle-like appearance. The town might be the capital of the Republic of Merijool due to its geographically neutral location.

### Primal Sapling

The Primal Sapling is a colossal, flowering tree in southern Merijool. Jungle trees grow in the area surrounding it (likely surviving remnants of the ecosystem from before the Frostfang Catastrophe), and this portion land is encircled by mountains that obscure outside view. A mysterious, stone, pyramidal temple lays underneath the tree's canopy. The Primal Sapling sprouted from the remains of the much greater [[Primal Tree]] that existed in the First Avihm until its [[Felling|destruction]]. Unlike its predecessor, however, the Sapling has malicious intent, as it seeks only to grow beyond control.

### Ruins of Kamt

Kamt was an ancient stone city in northeastern Merijool, built at the base of Mt. Mekta. An ice statue makes it apparent that its residents worshiped Loe. The city now lies in ruins.

### Shrine of Eternal Flame

The [[Shrine of Eternal Flame]] is a pyramid-shaped stone temple and [[Devotion|devotion]] site to Lai in the region's northwest. Its name comes from the sacred, eternal flame at its center, which once burned perpetually but is no longer lit.
