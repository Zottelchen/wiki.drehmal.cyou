![[Tharxaxplains3.webp]{ align=right width="300" }

**North Tharxax** is a relatively small region in western [[Overworld|Drehmal]]. It forms the northern part of the broader Tharxax Plains, whose name is derived from a [[Maelmari]] corruption of "Tharhan", the ancient name for the local land and people.

## Geography

North Tharxax blends into the similar but larger [[South Tharxax]] region to the south. It also borders [[Nimahj Swamp]] to the west, across the River Salah, and the [[Ebony Veldt]] to the north. The Burnt Mountains separate the region from [[Capital Valley]] to the east.

North Tharxax has a temperate environment, and its landscape is dominated by grasslands and woods of oak and acacia, including a swampy strip of wooded land stretching across its southern border. The region is also characterized by its high plateaus with steep, brown-and-orange striped cliffs.

**Environmental Sub-Regions:**
- Oak woods with podzol in north
- Swampy acacia and oak woods in south

The castle-town of [[Fort Nimahj]] stands on a cliff edge overlooking the River Salah on the region's western border.

## History

The fertile land along the River Salah was settled in the earliest days of Av2 by tribes people who survived the [[Felling|Felling of the Primal Tree]]. Kingdoms emerged, and eventually the [[First Tharhan Empire]] formed. When it collapsed, yielding [[Six Tharhan Kingdoms|six kingdoms]], North Tharxax came under the rule of Nimahj and possibly Loraga.

Following the [[War of Unification]] between the Tharhan kingdoms, the [[Casain Empire]], and [[Caer Adacia]], the latter victoriously established the [[Second Tharhan Empire]], which ruled the region for almost two centuries. Power was then handed to [[Avsohm]], and North Tharxax was provincially governed by House Silar, based at Fort Nimahj. Under Avsohm's reign, local people did hard labor in the region's fields, but they also received new technology that improved quality of life.

After the [[Fall of Avsohm|empire's fall]], Tharhan experienced a surge of anti-Avsohmic sentiment, and the land was seized by [[Maelihs]] during the [[Dune Wars]]. The land remained under [[Empire of Maelihs|his empire's]] control for most of the Third Avihm, up until the [[Battle for Drehmal]]. The [[Maelmari]] were driven out by [[Insohm|Insohmic]] forces. The Order of Insohm may have also allocated the territory to its own member ststes.

Insohm soon dissolved, and Maelihs's armies set out to reclaim their lands. Fort Nimahj has successfully resisted their attempts to capture it until the present day, and the struggle is most likely still ongoing.

North Tharxax's Terminus tower is situated on elevated ground in the region's center. It is located within the ruins of a small, square, stone castle, with the partially-intact keep sheltering the tower's bottom half. There are no hostile entities present.

## Points of Interest

### Fort Nimahj

Fort Nimahj is a fortified settlement snd market atop a cliff in the region's west. It was likely built as a military stronghold by the kingdom of Nimahj in the mid-Second Avihm. Over history, it changed hands between the Second Tharhan Empire, Avsohm (serving as House Silar's capital), Maelihs, and Insohm. Unlike the surrounding land, Fort Nimahj has so far managed to hold off Maelihs's invasions, and it appears that battles are still actively being fought. It is also the only center of [[Virtuo|Virtuo's]] faith in the West. Despite Fort Nimahj's independence, there is no clear central authority in the fort or surrounding land.
