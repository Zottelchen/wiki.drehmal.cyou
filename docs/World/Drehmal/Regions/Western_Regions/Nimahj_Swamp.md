# Nimahj Swamp

![[NS_landscape.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

**Nimahj Swamp** is a small region in western [[Drehmal|Overworld]]. Its name references the swampy terrain and the historical Lake Nimahj, which once covered part of the region's area but has mostly dried up in the years since.

## Geography

Nimahj Swamp is located north of the Tharxax Sea, which lies north of [[The Carmine|the Carmine]] itself. The region borders [[Anyr'Nogur]] to the west, the [[Ebony Veldt]] to the north, and [[North Tharxax|North]] and [[South Tharxax|South]] Tharxax across the River Salah to the east.

Nimahj Swamp can be divided into distinct sub-regions. The region's southern end consists of a partially-enclosed, shallow bay inhabited by many mangrove trees (formed with dark oak and acacia wood). North of this is a thick, swampy spruce forest. Further north is a plateau with green and brown cliffs and birch trees on top. On the northern end of the region is another swampy forest, comprised of a mix of oak and spruce trees, as well as a few giant mushrooms. Along the bank of the River Salah on the region's east edge are grasslands defined by white crags and cliffs, patches of birch trees, and sand beaches.

## History

The northern half of Nimahj Swamp was originally covered by Lake Nimahj. The remaining land was likely territory belonging to the [[First Tharhan Empire]] in the early Second Avihm. After it split up into [[Six Tharhan Kingdoms|six kingdoms]], the region possibly came under the rule of Loraga, or alternatively, Erxsival or Salahnar. 

Following the [[War of Unification]], Nimahj Swamp was probably controlled by the [[Second Tharhan Empire]], who then transferred the land to the [[Avsohm|Avsohmic Empire]] without a fight. It was used by Avsohm (in particular by [[Blue Exodus]]) to house Blue Exodus' headquarters, the [[Exodus Citadel]].

With [[Fall of Avsohm|Avsohm's fall]] came the dawn of the Third Avihm. It appears this was around this time when Lake Nimahj began to gradually vanish. [[Maelihs]] conquered the region along with most of the West during the [[Dune Wars]], and [[Empire of Maelihs|his empire]] would keep hold of the land until the late Third Avihm, when the [[Insohm|Insohmic Coalition]] pushed his troops away and to the south in the [[Battle for Drehmal]].

The Order of Insohm's occupied land may have been distributed to Insohmic member states participating in the war. However, Maelihs's forces returned soon after and regained authority, as the Insohmic alliance disintegrated. The region continues to be governed by Maelihs (and his [[Burnt Generals|generals]]) in the present day.

## Terminus Tower

Nimahj Swamp's [[Terminus Network#Towers|Terminus tower]] is situated atop a narrow and steep stone outcrop at the northern end of the region. A path of wooden bridges winding around and through the rock formation provides access from the ground to the top of the outcrop and base of the tower. The area is decorated by large spider webs (made of cobwebs) and infested with spiders.

## Points of Interest

### Alchemical Fortress

Within the thick swamp of the region's south, there is an [[Nimahj Alchemy Fortress|unnamed stone fortress]] in a decaying and overgrown state, which is occupied by a group of hostile "Nimahj Alchemists" (witches). There is no provided background for this stronghold or the coven residing in it.

### Exodus Citadel

Exodus Citadel was part of the headquarters of [[Blue Exodus]] during the Avsohmic era. The prismarine structure was constructed at the bottom of Lake Nimahj as a security measure, and it served as an entrance point to the underground [[Exodus Vault]]. Its ruins now lay exposed on the surface of a swamp left behind after the lake dried up.
