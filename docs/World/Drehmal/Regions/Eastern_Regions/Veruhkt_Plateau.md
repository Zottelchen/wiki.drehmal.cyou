# Veruhkt Plateau

![[VP_landscape2.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

The **Veruhkt Plateau** is a small region in northeastern [[Overworld|Drehmal]], consisting of woods and elevated plains. As its name suggests, most of the region is encompassed by a large plateau. The name "Veruhkt" refers to the culture that was once present in the region, which drew great inspiration from the moon of [[Lo'Veruhkt]].

## Geography

Veruhkt Plateau is located between the Nahynaga Mountains to the south, separating the region from [[Grand Pike Canyon]], and another mountain range to the north, dividing it from [[Faehrcyle]]. The region also borders [[Akhlo'Rohma]] to the west and [[Highfall Tundra]] to the east.

The region's west is covered in spruce woods with podzol ground, and it lays near sea level. The elevation climbs steeply eastward, forming one edge of a plateau. The highlands on the plateau are mostly flat, with grasslands and rocky plains. This area is also home to the Tinaxi Pools, which have vividly-colored red, orange, yellow, green and blue basins drawing inspiration from the real-life [Yellowstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park) geyser basins. They are also the source of the Resting River, creating a massive waterfall at the edge of the Veruhkt Plateau and running west through Akhlo'Rohma. The plateau drops off suddenly at a steep cliff on the region's east side, forming the border with Highfall Tundra.

**Environmental Sub-Regions:** 

- Spruce woods with podzol floor in west and north <br>
- Highland plains/tundra in east

There are no major settlements in Veruhkt Plateau.

## History

In the Second Avihm, Veruhkt Plateau was home to a highly advanced civilization who sought to reach the moon of Lo'Veruhkt, hidden out of sight beneath Drehmal. These Veruhktian people were likely ruled by a centralized political power, based in the capital city of Veruhkaan. In an event known by the Veruhktians as the "Desecration", the region was conquered by [[Anyr|Emperor Anyr]] of [[Avsohm]] and its Tech-Priests were massacred, leaving only three alive and in hiding. Veruhkaan was renamed to Sal'Veruhkt. 

After [[Fall of Avsohm|Avsohm's demise]], Veruhkt probably regained sovereignty for an indefinite but short amount of time. Eventually the region came under the rule of the [[Kingdom of Dusps]], who subjected the Veruhktians to harsh oppression and were responsible for the extinction of their culture and people.

## Points of Interest

### Altar of Insight

![[VP_landscape1.png]]

The [[Altar of Insight]] was an ancient, stone ziggurat by the Tinaxi Pools that contained unique Veruhktian technology and served as an important religious site. The Lens of Insight, a device capable of seeing through the land of Drehmal itself, was held underneath the Altar, and it was used to locate and observe Lo'Veruhkt hidden beneath the [[disc]]. The Altar was devastated and pillaged by Avsohm during the Desecration.

### Battle Pizzazzle

Battle Pizzazzle is an ancient Veruhktian tower that was repurposed into a challenge for adventurers by a wealthy man named Vikhtor Ohna. The tower has a multitude of stories, each with small hazards that must be surpassed in order to reach the stairs to the next level. A [[Artifacts#Vikhtor's Spoils|prize]] is kept at the top. The business idea was ultimately unsuccessful, as few to none showed up to compete.

### Ruins of Sal'Veruhkt

Sal'Veruhkt, formerly Veruhkaan, was the capital city of the Veruhktian state. It was given its newer name after being conquered by Avsohm. It was possibly destroyed by the Kingdom of Dusps, or it fell into a ruined state as its population was lost under Duspian rule.

### Solitary Cabin

On the side of the hill where the region's Terminus tower sits is a wood-and-stone cabin that houses a lone [[Runic Blacksmith]], positioned at a small, outdoor workshop to the side of the house.
