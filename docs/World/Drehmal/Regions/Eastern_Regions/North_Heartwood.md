# North Heartwood

![[NH_landscape.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

The **North Heartwood** is a region in central-eastern [[Overworld|Drehmal]], and the northern part of the greater Heartwood region. As its name suggests, its landscape is densely forested, to the point where the shade allows mobs to spawn at all times in most places.

## Geography

The North Heartwood stretches from the eastern shores of the Mouth of Drehmal to the Nahynaga Mountains, Verdant Mountains and Eye of Vir to the east. The Nahynaga Range forms a boundary between this region and the [[Spearhead Forest]], and the [[Verdant Labyrinth]] provides a means of reaching the [[Black Jungle]] through the Verdant Mountains. The region also borders the [[South Heartwood]] to the south, [[Purity Peaks]] to the north and [[Capital Valley]] to the northwest.

The North Heartwood's environment is relatively uniform. Nearly the entire region is covered in thick dark oak forest (with varying levels of density), also populated by tree-sized mushrooms with white stems and red, orange or yellow caps. A few oak and birch trees are also present. A thin strip of land where a road may have been appears to have been cleared out, roughly between Rhaverik and Gozak, with little to no trees. The typical trees that are found throughout the region are short and broad, with drooping foliage and outstretched roots. The terrain is dominated by plateaus, alongside purple or brown cliffs and rocks. A small section of land in the region's southeastern corner, on the coast of the Eye of Vir, consists of grassland and small patches of woods. Sandy beaches can also be found across the region's coasts.

**Environmental Sub-Regions:**

- Sparse forest in northwest <br>
- Hilly grassland and woods in southeast <br>
- Grassland valley with lake and river in southwest <br>
- The Underwood in southwest, in a cove beneath the surface

The North Heartwood is home to the [[Drehmal]]-worshiping town of [[Gozak]] in the eastern forest.

## History

In the Second Avihm, several different kingdoms emerged in the Heartwood. One of these was the [[Gozaki Union]] (centered in Gozak), which was likely formed as a result of multiple states merging, as implied by its name. The Aspect [[Muhs]] also made his home in the North Heartwood. The [[Tidal Dynasty]] clashed with the Gozaki Union and seized some of its territory. Soon, the rest of the region came under [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] rule.

After the [[Fall of Avsohm|fall of Avsohm]], the Gozaki Union and other kingdoms were revived. Gozak joined the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]] in its early years, and fought on the side of the loyalists in the [[Insohmic Civil War]]. It was during this war that they were invaded by the Tidal Dynasty again, who was defeated, and the separatists also ultimately surrendered. The North Heartwood served as an important region for the Order of Insohm's mining, research and military operations, until its collapse at the end of the Third Avihm. By the Fourth Avihm, Gozak was the only kingdom remaining in the North Heartwood.

## Points of Interest

### Castle Scarstone

[[Castle Scarstone]] is an ancient, ruined castle in the mountains northeast of Gozak. It was originally used by the Insohmic Coalition as a military base during the [[Battle for Drehmal]], but it fell out of use (and was possibly destroyed) when the Order of Insohm dissolved. Today, the ruins are inhabited by [[Mihkmari]] scavengers. An immense cavern in the mountains beneath the castle conceals a mysterious pyramid from the First Avihm, as well as the [[One Thousand Scars]] legendary.

### Gozak

[[Gozak]] is a town in the region's east, secluded by a wall and moat from the dangers of the forest outside. Its buildings are composed of mostly quartz and dark oak wood, with unique, curved roofs. Historically, Gozak has been the regional center of power, being the capital city of the Gozaki Union.

### Insohmic Fortress

A fortress atop a crag in the northeastern North Heartwood was once used by the Order of Insohm to research Avsohmic technology. [[Ultva|Master Ultva]] abandoned his commanding role in their efforts after the scientists failed to replicate an ancient Avsohmic chestplate. Even with the Order gone today, the fortress still houses mercenaries and the laboratory continues to be worked in.

### Rhaverik Inn & Trading Post

Rhaverik Inn & Trading Post is located on the road outside the former town of Rhaverik, consisting of an inn with a walled market attached. Each of the market's 7 vendors are part of a trading puzzle, in which one "Sublime Honey" is initially purchased for 12 scales at the Bee Enthusiast, which must be traded at the Birchant for an "Ancient Birch Log", and so on, until until the player obtains an item that can be traded for a runic catalyst at the Runic Machinist.

### Ruins of Kazzani

Kazzani was a town on the southern edge of the North Heartwood in the Second Avihm, sitting on a lake. It was the birthplace of renowned Avsohmic captain and novelist, [[Devro Ihb]]. The town was likely destroyed by Skullbeasts during [[Maelihs]]'s desolation of the [[South Heartwood]].

### Ruins of Rhaverik

Rhaverik was a town situated by a lake in the northwestern portion of the North Heartwood. After the "Hovadchear Vein" and "Coalition Seam" (underground rehntite deposits) were discovered beneath the town, Master Ultva of Insohm commissioned a large mine here to supply the Order. The intense excavation caused tunnels to collapse, creating sinkholes on the surface that destroyed buildings, and resulting in tens of casualties. Most of Rhaverik's population fled after this incident, and eventually it was rendered completely deserted, except for one lone resident.

### Underwood

The Underwood is a series of vast, lush caverns and waterways underneath a plateau in the region's southwest. It was once the den of [[Muhs]], Aspect of Beasts, before he was slain here. Inside the Underwood are a castle guarded by "Templars of the Beast," which houses the [[Heartaxe]] legendary, and a small Drehmari village farther east.
