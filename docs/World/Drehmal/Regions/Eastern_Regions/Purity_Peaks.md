# Purity Peaks

![[PP_landscape.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

**Purity Peaks** (formerly known as **Tehrmia**) is a grassy, lightly-wooded, and mountainous region in central-east [[Overworld|Drehmal]]. The region is littered with pointed white peaks from which it takes its name.

## Geography

Purity Peaks is located between the Central Plains ([[Capital Valley]] and the [[Gulf of Drehmal]] region) to the west and the Nahynaga mountains to the east, the latter separating the region from [[Spearhead Forest]]. It also borders [[Akhlo'Rohma]] to the north and the [[North Heartwood]] to the south.

Purity Peaks is recognizable for the isolated, pure white crags that can be found scattered throughout the region. Sometimes, these mountains are hollow, and contain smaller structures or loot inside. Stone of the same type makes up the region's small cliffs. The landscape consists of plains and woods, the trees being birch and oak, as well as spruce at the base of the mountains in the east. The region is also filled with lakes and rivers.

Purity Peaks is home to the [[Dahroehl]]-worshiping [[Tehrmari|Ro'Tehrmari]] town of [[Hevhlak]] in the region's center.

## History

In the Second Avihm, Purity Peaks was known as "Tehrmia", due to the significant number of Tehrmari present in the region. It was mandatory for all La'Tehrmari to make a pilgrimage from their home on the moon [[LD|Lo'Dahr]] to Drehmal, and they would periodically descend from their monastery in the Nahynaga mountains to spend a year with the [[Drehmari]] in the region's many small villages. During this time, [[Tehrmari#Wingmakers|Wingmakers]] would seek Drehmari who were qualified for ascension to Tehrmari. Tehrmia was incorporated into the [[Avsohm|Empire of Avsohm]], who in their later years constructed the research complex [[Sal'Mevir]] in this region.

Many La'Tehrmari did not enjoy staying on Drehmal, and the [[Scalebound]] eventually made the journey optional. Visits by La'Tehrmari mostly ceased, although the monastery in the mountains continues to be inhabited by priests and a Ro'Tehrmari population still thrives in the region today.

## Terminus Tower

The Purity Peaks [[Terminus Network#Towers|Terminus tower]] is located in a small swampy patch in the region's center. Its lower half is ringed by a quartz structure and must be climbed by jumping across the beams of the structure, culminating in a pressure plate that gives the player levitation 5 for 7 seconds, allowing for an easy ascent to the top. There are no hostile entities present.

## Points of Interest

### Abandoned Tehrmian Village

A dilapidated village in the region's northeast corner, in the shadow of the Nahynaga mountains, was once home to a thriving community that was frequented by [[Tehrmari]]. It now lays empty.

### Hevhlak

[[Hevhlak]] is a town populated by Ro'Tehrmari in central Purity Peaks. Its residents worship [[Dahroehl|Dahroehl, Aspect of Freshwater]]. Its buildings consist of quartz and smooth stone, with slightly curved, birch wood roofs.

### Scalebound Monastery

A pale stone temple and living quarters sit high in the Nahynaga Mountains northeast of Purity Peaks. It once housed many La'Tehrmari pilgrims and Wingmakers, and was used for transportation between Drehmal and [[LD|Lo'Dahr]]. Today, with the now-optional task of visiting Drehmal being unpopular for Tehrmari, its connection to Lo'Dahr is severed and the monastery is only home to a limited number of Scalebound Priests.

### Sal'Mevir

[[Sal'Mevir]] was a combination city/research facility in the southeastern mountains of Purity Peaks, entirely dedicated to the Avsohmic [[DoS|Department of Science]]'s research and manufacturing operations. It is the largest example of the signature white-and-purple late-Avsohmic architecture, and its structure is still well-preserved by ancient stasis technology. The ruins are patrolled by mechanical guards.

Sal'Mevir is the site of the 25% completion story event.
