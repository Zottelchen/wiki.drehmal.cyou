## Lore

Mohta is a remaining city of the Tri-Moon theocracy, an ancient civilization that, instead of worshipping the gods of the realm (Drehmal, Maelihs and Virtuo), cast their prayers to the moons Lorahn, Lohrun, and Lo'Dahr. In Av2 1383 several Necromancers fled the Chosen Kingdom (what would become the Avsohmic empire) due to rising hatred and discrimination towards the magic. As Avsohm grew, so did their feelings towards necromancy, and the theocracy based themselves in Lorahn'Khal. As the region bordered the domain of Maelihs, Mael would occasionally send raids and squadrons to the Loran'Khal coast to create chaos, and eventually the Tri-Moon Theocracy responded with a massive undead army. To combat the threat, Avsohm assassinated the theocracies high priests, leading to its downfall and allowing Avsohm to occupy Lorahn'Khal in Av2 1748. However, without the preists or necromancers of Lorahn'Khal, the undead army was and remains and uncontrolled threat.
