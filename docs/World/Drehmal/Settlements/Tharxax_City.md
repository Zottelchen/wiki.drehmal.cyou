## Lore

Tharxax city is an [[Insohm|Insohmic]] era city under [[Maelihs]]' rule, although many see it as under the chaos deities protection. To uphold his laws, a delegate of Maelihs is stationed in the city, ensuring everyone remains obedient to Maelihs and that no citizens leave the city borders. Tharxax is a wealthy city much of its industries' exports being mechanical goods; however, much of its profits are given to Maelihs in exchange for his "protection". Tharxax makes these mechanical goods from raw resources imported from [[Ebonrun]]. To prevent an uprising, Maelihs and his delegate feed the people of Tharxax falsehoods about the followings of [[Virtuo]], stating that those who worship the goddess of peace are forced to face complete and utter perfection.
