# Rhaveloth

![[rhaveloth.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

**Rhaveloth** is a large, walled city found along the border of [[The Carmine]] and the [[Crimson Gorge]] regions, and the only official town inhabited predominantly by [[Maelmari]]. Acting as a gateway to the Crimson Gorge (and by extent, controlling land access to the [[Hellcrags]]), Rhaveloth is the largest city in the [[Empire of Maelihs]].

!!! abstract "Location"
    Approximate Coordinates: `-2788, 47, 5158`

As Rhaveloth is made up overwhelmingly of Maelmari, who are (mostly) re-skinned vanilla Minecraft piglins, players seeking to explore Rhaveloth will need to be prepared to fight their way through dozens to hundreds of enemies. Most of the Maelmari are regular piglins, meaning that they can be distracted with gold or made passive if a player wears golden armor, but there are many Maelmari Brutes in the town as well, who cannot be pacified. Maelmari will respawn passively in the area, making population estimates difficult, but there are typically between 150 and 200 inhabitants in Rhaveloth upon a player's first arrival.

Rhaveloth is built at the very southwestern edge of the Carmine, pressed up partially against the mountains of the Crimson Gorge, and surrounded on all other sides by a massive wooden wall. A singular drawbridge allows access to the city's main, central road from the northeast, and following this road directly will take players straight into the Crimson Gorge, eventually leading to the Hellcrags.

Rhaveloth is one of the densest areas on the map, with several different layers of buildings and districts throughout its land area. Buildings are varied, often utilizing spruce and dark oak wood, blackstone and its polished/brick variants, Taihryte and red Taihryte (nether) bricks, and carnelian (crimson) wood.

Rhaveloth is the only official town to not contain an [[Adventuring Merchant]].

Entering Rhaveloth for the first time grants the "City of Chaos" advancement.

## Layout/Points of Interest

![[rhaveloth_map.png]]{ width="400" }
> The in-game map of Rhaveloth, found at two different locations in the town.

Rhaveloth contains several distinct areas, but at the highest level, can easily be divided into two halves: the northern half, which lies north and west of the central road ("Crimson Way"), and the southern half, which lies south and east of Crimson Way.

## Northern Rhaveloth

Northern Rhaveloth is home to the [[Drehmari]] section of the city, the [[Runic Blacksmith]], most of the town's custom merchants, an air cargo platform that towers over the rest of the city, and more.

### Bank

Immediately to the right upon entering Rhaveloth, a building with "BANK" spelled out in banners can be seen. This building is home to a "Bank Teller" merchant, who will allow players to exchange their scales for gold, albeit at a poor (3:1) rate compared to the Bank Teller in [[Firteid]].

### The Boar's Thighs Fine Dining

Also located along Crimson Way on the north side, but farther down than the bank, this building is home to two custom merchants. A merchant named "Landlord" sells the deed to a property in Rhaveloth, and another merchant named "Waiter" sells various foods.

### Briggam's Bazaar

Located along the inside of the northern wall, Briggam's Bazaar is a marketplace home to 5 different custom, permanent merchants, similar in scope to the ones found at most other towns. Near these small trading stalls, a building labeled "BONES" is also found, containing a [[Untitled Books#Skeleton Stand-Up|book of skeleton-related puns]].

### Air Cargo Platform

In the center of northern Rhaveloth, a massive red/orange terracotta hill rises out of the ground, with a tower and scaffolding built into/around it. One large airship is found docked here, and several rail lines protrude from this tower to various points in northern Rhaveloth. This tower serves as the hub for cargo shipments in and out of Rhaveloth, and also connects to a set of rooms built higher into the mountain face, including the Quartermaster's Office.

### Blackthorn Forge

Located in the far northwest of the city, Blackthorn Forge is a blackstone building that houses several Maelmari, including the area's Maelmari [[Runic Blacksmith]]. Valuable mineral blocks and tools can also be picked up here.

### Drehmari Encampment

Just south of the forge, a walled-in district contains the town's [[Drehmari]] slaves and prisoners. This includes about a dozen Drehmari, as well as the Renegade Stonecarver, a secondary Runic Blacksmith who is the only non-Maelmari custom merchant in the town. Here, Drehmari are forced into manual labor for their captors, predominantly mining and farming.

## Unique Villagers

![[rhaveloth_market.png]]

There are a total of 14 custom, permanent merchants in Rhaveloth. Rhaveloth is the only official town which does not have an [[Adventuring Merchant]], and it is also home to two different traders that sell [[Artisan Items]], although only one is technically a [[Runic Blacksmith]]. All of these custom traders are technically villagers and not piglins, but almost all of them are re-skinned to look like the other Maelmari.

Almost all merchants in Rhaveloth will only accept gold ingots as the main form of currency, rather than scales.

## Lore

one of the only places where airships are still in use, since empire of mael knows how to use/make them still

### Merchant Respawn Commands

In the event that one of the custom merchants in Rhaveloth is turned into a witch or dies, the following commands can be used (through a command block) in order to respawn them. See [[FAQ#Can Custom Villagers Be Respawned?|this page]] for more information on these commands.
