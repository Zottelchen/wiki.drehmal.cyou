# Rhaveloth

![[rhaveloth.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

**Rhaveloth**, also sometimes called the **Crimson Oasis**, is a large, walled city found along the border of [[The Carmine]] and the [[Crimson Gorge]] regions, and the only official town inhabited predominantly by [[Maelmari]]. Acting as a gateway to the Crimson Gorge (and by extent, controlling land access to the [[Hellcrags]]), Rhaveloth is the largest city in the [[Empire of Maelihs]]. It is also home to the [[Sepulchral Altar]], the [[Devotion]] site for [[Maelihs]].

!!! abstract "Location"
    Approximate Coordinates: `-2788, 47, 5158`

As Rhaveloth is made up overwhelmingly of Maelmari, who are (mostly) re-skinned vanilla Minecraft piglins, players seeking to explore Rhaveloth will need to be prepared to fight their way through dozens to hundreds of enemies. Most of the Maelmari are regular piglins, meaning that they can be distracted with gold or made passive if a player wears golden armor, but there are many Maelmari Brutes in the town as well, who cannot be pacified. Maelmari will respawn passively in the area, making population estimates difficult, but there are typically between 150 and 200 inhabitants in Rhaveloth upon a player's first arrival.

Rhaveloth is built at the very southwestern edge of the Carmine, pressed up partially against the mountains of the Crimson Gorge, and surrounded on all other sides by a massive wooden wall. A singular drawbridge allows access to the city's main, central road from the northeast, and following this road directly will take players straight into the Crimson Gorge, eventually leading to the Hellcrags.

Rhaveloth is one of the densest areas on the map, with several different layers of buildings and districts throughout its land area. Buildings are varied, often utilizing spruce and dark oak wood, blackstone and its polished/brick variants, Taihryte and red Taihryte (nether) bricks, and carnelian (crimson) wood.

Rhaveloth is the only official town to not contain an [[Adventuring Merchant]].

Entering Rhaveloth for the first time grants the "City of Chaos" advancement.

## Layout/Points of Interest

![[rhaveloth_map.png]]{ width="400" }
> The in-game map of Rhaveloth, found at two different locations in the town.

Rhaveloth contains several distinct areas, but at the highest level, can easily be divided into two halves: the northern half, which lies north and west of the central road ("Crimson Way"), and the eastern half, which lies east and south of Crimson Way.

## Northern Rhaveloth

Northern Rhaveloth is home to the [[Drehmari]] section of the city, the [[Runic Blacksmith]], most of the town's custom merchants, an air cargo platform that towers over the rest of the city, and more.

### Bank

Immediately to the right upon entering Rhaveloth, a building with "BANK" spelled out in banners can be seen. This building is home to a "Bank Teller" merchant, who will allow players to exchange their scales for gold, albeit at a poor (3:1) rate.

### The Boar's Thighs Fine Dining

Also located along Crimson Way on the north side, but farther down than the bank, this building is home to two custom merchants. A merchant named "Landlord" sells the deed to a property in Rhaveloth, and another merchant named "Waiter" sells various foods.

### Briggam's Bazaar

Located along the inside of the northern wall, Briggam's Bazaar is a marketplace home to 5 different custom, permanent merchants, similar in scope to the ones found at most other towns. These include the Potion Master, Blaze Merchant, Crimson Merchant, Blackstone Merchant, and Gahrgi. 

Near these small trading stalls, a building labeled "BONES" is also found, containing a [[Untitled Books#Skeleton Stand-Up|book of skeleton-related puns]].

### Air Cargo Platform

In the center of northern Rhaveloth, a massive red/orange terracotta hill rises out of the ground, with a tower and scaffolding built into/around it. One large airship is found docked here, and several rail lines protrude from this tower to various points in northern Rhaveloth. This tower serves as the hub for cargo shipments in and out of Rhaveloth, and also connects to a set of rooms built higher into the mountain face, including the Quartermaster's Office.

### Blackthorn Forge

Located in the far northwest of the city, Blackthorn Forge is a blackstone building that houses several Maelmari, including the area's Maelmari [[Runic Blacksmith]]. Valuable mineral blocks and tools can also be picked up here.

### Drehmari Encampment

Just south of the forge, a walled-in district contains the town's [[Drehmari]] slaves and prisoners. This includes about a dozen Drehmari, as well as the Renegade Stonecarver, a secondary Runic Blacksmith who is the only non-Maelmari custom merchant in the town. Here, Drehmari are forced into manual labor for their captors, predominantly mining and farming.

## Eastern Rhaveloth

Eastern Rhaveloth is made up predominantly of residential buildings, including some of the poorer areas of the city. Notable points of interest are found mainly along the eastern/southern side of Crimson Way, with the significant exception being the Sepulchral Altar, the [[Devotion]] site for the chaos god, [[Maelihs]].

### Meat!

The first building on the left when entering Rhaveloth is a meat store, with "MEAT!" spelled out in banners on its wall facing Crimson Way. This building is home to the Meat Merchant, who buys and sells various raw meats.

### The Black Tree Restaurant & Bar

Just off Crimson Way next to the meat store, the Black Tree is a restaurant and bar, which only actually sells drinks (potions) to the player. The "Bartender" merchant is found here.

### Rafigefegifar's Bounty

A shop located along the northern wall of eastern Rhaveloth which is home to a merchant. This merchant sells cartography supplies.

### Sepulchral Altar

![[rhaveloth_altar.png]]
> The entrance to the Sepulchral Altar.

The [[Sepulchral Altar]] is the devotion site of [[Maelihs]], located beneath the cliff face south of eastern Rhaveloth. It can be accessed from the massive blackstone doorway in the southern mountainside, just off of Crimson Way to the southeast. A statue of Maelihs is found in front of its entrance, with a golden carrot and two chains at its base.

See the [[Sepulchral Altar|main Sepulchral Altar page]] for more details.

## Unique Villagers

![[rhaveloth_market.png]]

There are a total of 14 custom, permanent merchants in Rhaveloth. Rhaveloth is the only official town which does not have an [[Adventuring Merchant]], and it is also home to two different traders that sell [[Artisan Items]], although only one is technically a [[Runic Blacksmith]]. All of these custom traders are technically villagers and not piglins, but almost all of them are re-skinned to look like the other Maelmari.

Almost all merchants in Rhaveloth accept gold ingots as the main form of currency, rather than scales.

### Runic Blacksmith

The main Maelmari [[Runic Blacksmith]] in Rhaveloth is located at Blackthorn Forge in northwestern Rhaveloth. This Runic Blacksmith offers one armor trim, Runic Amplifiers, and a total of [[Artisan Items#Rhaveloth|five artisan items]], including the full 4-piece upgraded "Burnt Templar's" diamond artisan set. Each piece of this set adds +2 armor toughness and +4 max health (2 extra hearts) when worn.

## Lore

Rhaveloth is the single largest [[Maelmari]] settlement in the realm of Drehmal, and the functional capital of the [[Empire of Maelihs]]. The advancement for finding the city states that the "more 'civilized' and 'intelligent' Maelmari call this place their home", showing that Rhaveloth is functionally the center of what could truly be called Maelmari civilization and culture.

Rhaveloth appears to have existed since at least the early-mid second Avihm, as the emperor of the [[First Tharhan Empire]] is known to have sent his empire's felons to Rhaveloth, where they were converted into Maelmari and forced to serve Maelihs. This state was one of the first [[Drehmari]] societies to flourish after the [[Felling]], implying that Maelmari civilization at Rhaveloth predates most Av2 Drehmari reconstruction efforts. 

Rhaveloth's population is not made up entirely of Maelmari in-game or in the lore. In-game, a group of Drehmari have been imprisoned in the northwestern portion of the city, forced to mine and farm for their Maelmari captors, although the Renegade Stonecarver sells two artisan items which show that the Drehmari are building towards an escape attempt. Other Drehmari have been known to willingly come to Rhaveloth upon converting to Maelihs' faith, likely ending up being ascended to Maelmari either by choice or by force upon their entrance to the city.

Modern Rhaveloth seems to still be largely thriving, drawing on the resources of the Crimson Gorge and Carmine without suffering from the collapse of Drehmari civilization after the fall of [[Insohm]] and departure of [[Virtuo]]. The Empire of Maelihs did not lose significant amounts of knowledge or power with the collapse of [[Avsohm]] either, and as such, have been actively employing technology such as airships for over 1000 consecutive years, while the rest of Drehmal lost these technologies for several centuries.

Rhaveloth's populace is sustained primarily by meat. Some of this comes from farm animals in the city, but it is heavily implied that the majority of the meat is harvested from the [[Birthing Grounds]], the mysterious pit of flesh to the city's southeast.

## Extras

### Trivia

A small pit can be found beneath the main bridge to Rhaveloth, with a hole that the player can navigate through. Inside of this pit, a player head customized to look like that of Boba Fett is found, referencing the Sarlacc from Star Wars.

***

A basement in southwestern Rhaveloth contains one of the only items found inside barrels in the entire map. This item is a barrel, simply named "how". If removed and placed, it is found to contain another barrel, also named "how". 

### Soundtrack

Rhaveloth's theme song is "Crimson Oasis", by Drehmal composer Chris Nesja.
