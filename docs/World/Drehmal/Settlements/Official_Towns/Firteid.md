# Firteid

![[firteid.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

**Firteid** (pronounced "fur-tide"), also known as the **City of Tides**, is a large city located in the northwestern [[Black Jungle]] region. The city sits at the mouth of the region's largest river, on its southern bank where it deposits into the Eye of Vir. The city can be accessed through a path that leads directly to the north and originates in the [[Verdant Labyrinth]]. It is also notably connected via a long bridge to the [[Kiln of Virtuo]] in the west.

	Approximate Coordinates: `3981, 67, 3382` 

In the modern day, Firteid is the most populous city in eastern Drehmal, and it is by far the largest [[Drehmari]] settlement on the continent, rivaled in size only by the [[Maelmari]] capital of [[Rhaveloth]]. Over 350 Drehmari villagers inhabit Firteid in-game, with a population exceeding 500 when including the Kiln of Virtuo's inhabitants.

Firteid takes heavy inspiration in its architecture from traditional East Asian architectural styles. Buildings are predominantly constructed with a combination of spruce and dark oak wood, in addition to blue-green or red roofs, made of dark prismarine, carnelian planks, oxidized cut copper, or prismarine.

The entire city is built upon a hill which runs from west to east, sloping up towards the Tidal Palace in the west.

Entering Firteid for the first time grants the "City of Tides" advancement.

## Lore

Firtied first came to be with he formation of the Tidal Dynasty under the rule of the Tide Queen, a drehmari of unknown name and origin processing unlimited potentia, which she used to make herself immortal. The Tidal Dynasty quickly expanded, conquering the whole of the Black Jungle before fortifying their defenses and evolving into a totalitarian dictatorship to protect the Tide Queen. The powerful defenses meant a large military force, which the Tide Queen used to expand her kingdoms further into the Heartwood, capturing the coasts previously controlled by Gozak. Fearing her ruthlessness, the Avsohmic empire attempted an offensive against the Tide Queen and her kingdom, but was bested by the treacherous Black Jungle. Following the attack the Tide Queen ordered a state of isolation on Av2 1569. Soon after, Virtuo had reemerged, threatening the Tide Queens rule, who decided her best option was to declare herself a devout follower as to twist her populations view of the goddess and limited who was to enter [[The_Kiln|the Kiln of Virtuo]] east of the Firtied to ascend and become virmari. During this time, the Queen committed many more atrocities, culling those she deemed impure under Virtuo. Despite the Queen's actions, Virtuo did not act in fear of inciting a war, and her inaction lead to many more deaths. As Avsohm began dispatching surveillance drones, the Tide Queen ordered each one located over the Tidal Dynasties land be destroyed so that the Tide Queen could continue her method of leadership. In early Av3, the Tidal Dynasty had suffered with the many events of the time, but the Tide Queen only grew more confident, having spent centuries studying the blade with her infamous Masayoshi. In Av3 436, the Tide Queen lifted the isolation of her kingdom, being confident enough in her abilities to defend herself. However, this allowed the newly formed Insohmic Empire to learn of her tyranny and In Av3 628, councilman Hovadchear and a group of highly trained soldiers, backed by Virtuo, successfully assassinated the Tide Queen, ending her reign and allowing Insohm into the Black Jungle, but leading to the great Tide War.
