## Lore

The island of Sahd was once the battground of three kingdoms: Eruis to the north, Asahn to the south, and Durui to the east. For centuries the kingdoms fought for control fo Sahd until an arcanist named Vuhsan Degre channeled all the rage of Sahd into a single blade and shattered it, scattering the fragments across the island so that the hate may never be rediscovered, Because of this, Vuhsan was praised by the people of Sahd, and united they formed new Sahd. However, the malicious tide-queen, who ruled over the coast closest to the island of Sahd, prohibited access to the island and over hundreds of years it was forgotten from the history of the realm, left in isolation.
