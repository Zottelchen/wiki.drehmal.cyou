# Drabyel

![[drabyel_1.png]]

**Drabyel** (technically known as **New Drabyel**) is the official town of the [[Capital Valley]] region, located just south of the Capital Valley [[Terminus Network#Towers|Tower]]. The path that leads away from the [[Stasis Facility]], where the player first spawns, leads toward Drabyel, making this the first town found by most players.

    Approximate Coordinates: `502, 67, 1801`

Drabyel is a relatively humble, small village, but can serve as an effective early-game base, with a central location, a modest amount of loot and farmland, and proximity to the ruins of [[Av'Sal]]. The village sits on the tip of a peninsula jutting out into the northern reach of the Mouth of Drehmal, the inland sea in the center of the continent. 

The town is populated entirely by [[Drehmari]] who worship the serpentine creator deity [[Drehmal]]. Like all other official towns, Drabyel is home to an [[Adventuring Merchant]] and a [[Runic Blacksmith]].
