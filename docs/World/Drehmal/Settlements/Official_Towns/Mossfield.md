## Lore

Mossfield was originally constructed as a small port city by an ancient empire, but with the emergence of [[airships]], it quickly began to grow in size. Within a decade it became the most populous city in the [[Spearhead Forest]] and was selected as the capital for the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]]. As more kingdoms joined the Order, Mossfield continued to grow even larger and became the largest city in [[drehmari]] history. Mossfield was a hub of culture, knowledge, art, industry, and trade. However, as relations within the order became unsteady, riots ensued, and for Mossfield's immense size and diversity, it was all but destroyed. New Mossfield lies west of the ruins of Mossfield, where the [[Insohmic Library]] stands as the only remaining intact building. It still boasts one of the largest populations in Drehmal, however the quality of life is significantly lower than ever before, and there still is mass migration out of the city - people searching for better opportunities. \[Scroll down for more history, WIP\]
