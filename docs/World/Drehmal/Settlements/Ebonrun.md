## Lore 

Once part of the mighty Tharhan Empire, now the people
of Ebonrun are trapped under the watchful eye of Maelihs. Ebonrun's
economy almost solely based on mining operations, as the great Mount
Ebonfire, rich in useful and valuable ores, is located directly east of
the town. An open and operational mineshaft used by the Ebonrun people
can be located on the south face of the volcano.
