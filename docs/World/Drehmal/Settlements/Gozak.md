## Lore

Gozak was once a mighty Kingdom, stretching throughout the entire [Heartwood](The_Heartwood "wikilink"). The people of Gozak were respectful but fearsome, regarding themselves as the keepers of the Heartwood. The Gozaki revered [[Drehmal]], [[The Aspects|the Aspect]] of Growth Lahrs, and the Aspect of Beasts, Greatbeast Muhs. A hunting party [[The_Hunting_of_Greatbeast_Muhs|tracked and killed]] the Greatbeast, hoping to inherit his power and rid the world of monsters. This backfired, and mobs of Angry Gozaki hunted down the hunters, proving their role as Guardians of the Forest and its inhabitants.

This would all change in early Av3. [[Maelihs]] demonstrated his sheer destructive power during the [[Dune Wars]] and decimated more than half of the Heartwood Forest using the [[Skull Mother]]. Entire cities were reduced to nothing, and many more were abandoned. To this day, in what is known as [[Mael's Desolation]], nothing may grow. Present day Gozak is a shadow of its former self, now a recluse in the forest it once guarded.
