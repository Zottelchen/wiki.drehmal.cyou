# Settlements

!!! warning "OUTDATED PAGES!"
    The Settlements pages that currently exist on the wiki were written for Drehmal 2.1, and will be re-written soon. They are no longer in line with the style of this wiki, may contain outdated information, and do not contain information on pertinent new content.

Scattered throughout the map of [[Overworld|Drehmal]] are many different settlements. These settlements vary greatly in size, from populations of less than 10 to over 500 inhabitants. Settlements can be categorized into ["official" towns](/World/Drehmal/Settlements/Official_Towns/), which always have an [[Adventuring Merchant]], a special [[Advancements|advancement]] for discovering them under the "Civilization" category, and an inn of some sorts. There are also many ["unofficial" settlements](/World/Drehmal/Settlements/Other_Settlements/) across the map that are usually smaller.
