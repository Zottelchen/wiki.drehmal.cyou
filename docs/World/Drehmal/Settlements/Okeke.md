## Lore

A once dense jungle, Merijool, along with many other regions of the north, was forever changed by the frostfang catastrophe. Merijool is now a permanently autumnal forest featuring deep red leaves. The city of Okeke was severely affected by this change as much of what they offered as trade to build their economy was now unavailable to the people. The tribes of Merijool, a once powerful people able to defends against the fearsome warriors of the Casain Empire, now reduced to a small town in a land much different from what once was.
