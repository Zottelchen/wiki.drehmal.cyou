This location is home to some of the only [[Drehmari]] enemies in the game, a group of mercenaries who are actually re-skinned piglins.

## Layout/Walkthrough

There are multiple possible methods to enter the fortress, including through a set of iron bars at the ground level, or from exposed balconies at the top.

Starting from the bottom, players must dig through two layers of iron bars to find themselves in living quarters, full of Drehmari mercenaries. No unique loot is found here besides a [[Runic Catalyst]], in a room behind two iron doors.

A spiral staircase leads upwards from this area, first coming to another iron door. This door opens directly into a room with a mix of mercenaries and passive Drehmari villagers. This room has another Runic Catalyst in an item frame on the wall, as well as the [[Transcription of Artifact CXE-445]] book in a chest. The Drehmari appear to be attempting to build something in here.

Exiting out the opposite end of this room leads to an outside rampart, another spiral staircase, and a blackstone deck with two rooms accessible. The room on the left, full of hay bales, has a ladder leading up to the Mercenary Chief. This room is also home to the [[Artifacts#AvEP-83|AvEP-83]] artifact, as well as a strange schematic on the wall.

The room on the right leads to what looks to be a small landing dock for airships, as well as the top of the tower, with a lighthouse lantern.

## Lore

This research center, used by the Order of [[Insohm]], was attempting to research extremely durable materials recovered from [[Sal'Mevir]], as told by the AvEP-83 description. Master [[Ultva]] was in residence at this facility at one time, and the artifact suggests that this is the last place he was seen before leaving for the [[Avsohmic Vault]] where he would lose his mind.

The schematic on the wall represents a [[Aphelion|late-game build]], which Insohm was seemingly attempting to replicate.
