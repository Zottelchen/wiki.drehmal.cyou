# Rock Maw/Epicenter of the Desolation

![[rock_maw.png]]

The **Rock Maw**, (1) also known as the **Epicenter of the Desolation**, is the location in the [[South Heartwood]] where the [[Skullmother]] was deployed for the first and only time. This action dropped the equivalent of a massive nuclear bomb on the forest, permanently scorching over half of the Heartwood in an instant.

1. The term "Rock Maw" only comes from an old map made by co-creator Keeko100. It does not appear in current versions of the map.

The Rock Maw itself is a massive black mountain, which holds a central arena-like structure of bone blocks. A [[Fervor Stones#Stone of Worry|Stone of Worry]] is hidden in this area, but its main feature is Drehmal's first accessible open-world boss: [[Ossein]].

## Fervor Stone

The Fervor Stone in the area is located in a hidden crevice, marked by a few exposed bone blocks in the southeastern portion of the epicenter. Players can squeeze through a tight corridor to find a small shrine, holding a [[Fervor Stones#Stone of Worry|Stone of Worry]].

## Arena

A large arena is found in the center of the epicenter, made up of white bone blocks that sharply contrast with the blackness of the surrounding terrain. Here, players can initiate a battle with [[Ossein|Skull Disciple Ossein]], an open-world boss who drops a mythical weapon if defeated.
