## Layout/Notable Points

Loraga Keep is located directly along the road through Tharxax, between [[Tharxax City]] and [[Fort Nimahj]]. Upon ascending the staircase and passing through the main gate, players will find themselves in a large courtyard, with stables to the back right holding one of the only known zombie horses in the map.

Players can navigate throughout the castle, built around this main courtyard. Rooms are often overgrown, frequently containing chests and hostile mob spawners behind leaf blocks.

A particularly overgrown room in the southwest corner of the build is home to the [[Artifacts#Oversized Scalpel|Oversized Scalpel]] artifact.

A chest on a broken rampart at the far eastern edge holds a runic catalyst.

Towards the top of the castle, in a room with a large bed, the book [[A Need for Seeds]] is found. In the hallway just outside this room, players can break a chiseled stone brick to access the roof, where a small circular arena waits. Once a player approaches, the vindicator "Lost King" miniboss will spawn, and drop the [[Artifacts#Lost King's Crown|Lost King's Crown]] artifact on death.

The Lost King was guarding a tomb-like structure on the roof. Digging into it reveals a [[Fervor Stones#Stone of Luxury|Stone of Luxury]].

## Lore

Loraga Keep was likely the center of the [[Six Tharhan Kingdoms|Av2 Tharhan Kingdom]] of Loraga, a fierce rival of nearby [[Fort Nimahj|Nimahj]].

As seen in the lore book and first artifact found here, the people of the Loraga court were swayed by a mysterious stranger they called "The Provider". This person brought them bluegrape seeds, which the people of the keep became addicted to, eventually planting the seeds within themselves. This caused plants to sprout from their bodies, turning their blood green as they all were all driven to euphoric insanity.

## Extras

### Build Contest

Loraga Keep was the runner-up of the [2021 Ruins and Remnants Build Contest](https://youtu.be/Aff9XZDNAFw?si=8y_AxVbvFA0oKs_B&t=572), a competition held within the Drehmal community to create new ruined cities and remnants of ancient civilizations. The top three placers were added to the map in [[Drehmal v22|version 2.2]]. This build was submitted by the user Pogoshark as "Castle Tharxax", originally made as a survival base on [[Drehmal v21|version 2.1]] next to the [[South Tharxax]] Terminus tower. The [[Credits]] book is hidden in this build, a non-diegetic message from its original creator.
