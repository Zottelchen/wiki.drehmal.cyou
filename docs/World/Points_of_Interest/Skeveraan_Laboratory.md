The **Skeveraan Laboratory** (1) is a small dungeon structure located in western [[Spearhead Forest]]. The site of highly taboo, unethical experimentation on living [[Drehmari]] by an [alchemist](Alchemy.md) belonging to an obscure school, it is home to an [[Artifacts#Insulated Mask|artifact]] and some interesting lore.

## Layout

The structure is a large lakeside house, which appears normal at first. Its ground floor contains some strange laboratory setups, including a large set of gears in the western room, and the walls on the upper floor are all completely covered in the same painting. The [[Diary of an Insane Alchemist]] book is found in a bedroom on the upper level.

From the ground floor western room, a stairway descends down to the hidden basement, where the more disturbing aspects of the build are found. Immediately, players are greeted by what seems to be a wall of flesh, with a blank smile, and a closet holding the [[Artifacts#Insulated Mask|Insulated Mask]] artifact. In the next room, players will find a trapped, AI-less Drehmari villager kept in some kind of contraption, with the book [[The Skeveraan]] explaining this strange alchemist's beliefs and practices.

## Lore

The Skeveraan are an underground, taboo sect of Bionic [[Alchemy|Alchemists]], whose practices entail creating Frankenstein-esque monsters out of stitched-together body parts from the deceased.

This particular Skeveraan alchemist had been a resident of nearby [[Helmshire]], but left to practice his craft in secret, building the house. He became known to the people of the village as the friendly wizard of the lake, but in secret, he donned his mask at night and stole Helmshire's villagers from their homes, triggering the sequence of events that would lead to a large portion of the residents leaving.

The Skeveraan Laboratory is at least somehow tied to [[Vahid]], as the [[Old Villager's Journal]] in Helmshire mentions that the one-eyed mask worn by the Skeveraan in one sighting of him made people think that "Vahid had come to make us his next experiments". It is unclear what this exactly means, but it could imply that Vahid was a Skeveraan alchemist of some sort, or may have even been the original inhabitant of this house somehow, although this seems unlikely. The alchemist may have also been attempting to impersonate Vahid for some reason. Potentially of note, a flesh face similar to this one is found at the [[Avsohmic Vault]] alongside the [[Artifacts#Bloodied Nullblade|Bloodied Nullblade]], a location that was sealed off by Vahid.
