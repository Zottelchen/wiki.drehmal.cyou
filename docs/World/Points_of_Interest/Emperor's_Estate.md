# Emperor's Estate

![[Emperors_estate.webp]]

The **Emperor's Estate** is a dungeon in southeastern [[Sahd]]. Once home to the island's emperor, the palace complex is now inhabited by ghostly soldiers, and hides a powerful secret: a [[Frenzy#Fragment of Pain|fragment of the island's mythical weapon]].

## Layout

A path winds up to the estate from the water, starting at a dock and working towards a massive set of stone stairs. At the base of these stairs, the ruins of a settlement formerly held by the [[Maen]]-worshipping Osaigah Clan sits, with the [[An Elegy to Pain]] book and [[Artifacts#Glorybringer|Glorybringer]] artifact.

The first floor of the estate several rooms, including a kitchen, dining area, shrine to [[Vayniklah]] and [[Voynahla]], open courtyards and small gardens, a library, and the throne of the emperor. The main hall can also be accessed from this floor, containing several enemies and a statue of [[Mari]]. 

To the south, a path extends to the basement of a large, separate tower. At the very top of this tower, players will find a piece of paper titled "Cursed Paper". This item's description reads:

> They've breached the entrance. I can't safely leave so I'll be hiding the fragment within the estate. Atop the chandelier in the great hall - nobody would think to climb up there.

Back in the main palace, the second floor of the estate is home to a row of bedrooms on either side of the main hall, and the third floor seems to be mostly unused. From this floor, players can bridge up to the chandelier, climbing up to discover the Fragment of Pain.

## Enemies

Throughout the Emperor's Estate, ghostly enemies named "Pained Spirit" or "Possessed Armor" patrol the grounds. These enemies, actually invisible zombies, appear as floating suits of armor, and can deal significant damage.

An evoker wearing a custom-textured mask, named "Lord of Pain", is also found in the great hall.

## Lore

The Emperor's Estate was the home of the Emperor of Sahd, the ruler who united the historically warring factions of the island. A series of four very short lore books—[[Servant's Journal]], [[Crumpled Notes]], [[Scribbled Notes]], and [[Cursed Revelation]]—tells the story of how the estate came to its current condition.

A group of bandits laid siege to the estate in search of the [[Frenzy]] fragment contained there, and although they were initially unable to break into the palace's walls, they did cut the emperor's people off from the rest of the island. Over the course of several months, the palace's inhabitants went insane, and a man (presumably the emperor) eventually came up with a solution. He cast a curse that turned the bandits into the ghostly enemies that the player can find, forever forced to guard the Frenzy fragment.

## Extras

### Trivia

The Emperor's Estate was the first build for Drehmal made by developers DomeMaster and Yllusive, made by the duo in mid-late 2020. It was officially added to the map in [[Drehmal v21|version 2.1]], and set the stage for them to eventually become full developers. 

Two references to the duo are found in the build.

The first is a set of graves in a courtyard on the first floor, beneath a pink acacia tree. The left grave reads:

> DomeMaster <br>
> Imperial ARCHitect <br>
> Bless this gROUND

The right grave reads:

> Yllusive <br>
> Great engineer <br>
> They never did find the body

The second reference is on the second floor, where each builder has a dedicated room, as denoted by signs outside the rooms.
