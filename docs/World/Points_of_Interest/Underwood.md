# Underwood

![[underwood.png]]

The **Underwood**, also known as the **Beast's Den**, is an underground system of caverns in the [[North Heartwood]], formerly home to the Aspect of Beasts, [[Muhs]]. It is currently home to a small [[Drehmari]] settlement, the [[Heartaxe]] legendary, and an [[Artifacts#Rusted Sabatons|artifact]], along with many other small loot structures.

## Layout

> An in-game map of the Underwood. The entrance is located at the western end, with an alternative tunnel out from the east, by the village.

The Underwood is very lush, and sports a diverse array of fungus and plant life, as well as lush cave mobs such as axolotls.

### Entrance/Heartaxe

The Underwood is most easily accessed from the west, at a cove in the inland sea known as the Mouth of Drehmal. Proceeding directly east, players will encounter a small island with a small stone tower. This relatively small tower, guarded by enemies named "Templar of the Beast", houses the [[Heartaxe]] on its ground floor.

### Beehive

In the far southeastern corner is a massive beehive, inside of which the [[Artifacts#Rusted Sabatons|Rusted Sabatons]] are found, the remnants of the [[Hunting Party]]'s Soldier.

### Village/Exit

At the eastern end of the Underwood is a small Drehmari village, including a [[Runic Catalyst]]. A long tunnel full of rabbits leads east from this village, re-emerging at the surface of the North Heartwood, near the Twinrock River.

## Lore

The Underwood was the home of [[Muhs|Greatbeast Muhs]], Aspect of Beasts, and the Drehmari living here may have been part of the Coven of Muhs. Muhs was famously tracked down to this location in late Av2 and slain by a mortal [[Hunting Party]].
