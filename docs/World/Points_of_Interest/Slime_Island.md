# Slime Island

![[slime_island.png]]

The **Slime Island** is a massive island inside of a large lake, east of [[Tharxax City]]. Just northeast of the ruins of [[Semehol]], it was a significant source of industry for the [[South Tharxax]] region.

The island is made out of a mixture of true slime blocks, moss, green and lime terracotta, and green/lime concrete.

The island only has two significant points of interest:

- A stone tower with a long chasm ending in a layer of slime blocks, named "Major Lue's HOUSE OF BOUNCE" by a sign outside. <br>
- A protrusion of slime near the center with a singular glazed green terracotta block, hiding the [[Artifacts#Slime Chrysalis|Slime Chrysalis]] artifact.

## Lore

Nothing is known about this island's origins in canon, but it does have a place in the region's history.

The collection, refinement, and shipping of this slime (for unclear purposes) was a significant industry in nearby towns, including [[Semehol]] and [[Tharxax City]].
