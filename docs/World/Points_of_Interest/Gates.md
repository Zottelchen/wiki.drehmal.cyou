# Gates

Throughout [[Overworld|Drehmal]], players may find mysterious gateway structures, such as the one pictured above. These predominantly take the same form, appearing as tall quartz structures with deep blue bases. The potential function of these gates is a very common question for first-time Drehmal players. 

It is easiest to simply leave them alone until coming across an explanation for their purpose naturally (these explanations do exist in relatively prominent areas), but for a short explanation with minimal spoilers, click the box below.

??? warning "Gateway Hint"
    These structures serve as knowledge gates, allowing access to late-game content *if* you know exactly how to activate them. An explicit explanation for how to do this is not provided in the map until relatively late in the story's progression, and explaining it further risks massively spoiling the experience.

    However, if you truly must know what the gates do, or have already solved them and simply want to read about them without the spoiler-proofed language, see [[Lo'Dahr|this page]].

## Gate Locations

There are six of these structures located in Drehmal, five of which take on the default quartz gateway appearance. One, located in [[Spearhead Forest]], appears as a stump instead.

## Broken Gates

In addition to the 6 gates listed above, there are 2 which share the normal structure, but have been broken beyond repair. These gates cannot be meaningfully interacted with.
