This name comes from the advancement granted upon entering this area for the first time, "Grave of Frost".

## Layout

The Grave of Frost is a very simple structure, consisting of a roughly circular stone brick wall surrounding a pit in the ground. The entire structure is guarded by Strays wearing iron and chainmail armor, in one of two variants: **Frostfang Gravewatchers**, who are stationary and have bows, and **Frostfang Gravetenders**, who are armed with swords.

Players need only enter the wall from one side, defeat the enemies, and make their way to the small gazebo in the center of the pit, which contains a chest with the [[Frostfang]] legendary weapon.

This grave also bears two signs:

> Rest In Peace <br>
> Homli Tahsgan <br>
> King of the North <br>
> Guardian of Snow 
> 
> Defended his homeland from the villainy of Avsohm

## Lore

Whether or not this is the true grave of [[Homli Tahsgan]] is unclear, as he is presumed to have been consumed by the storm that he started during the [[Frostfang Catastrophe]] by some sources. It may be his true burial site, or simply a memorial to him.
