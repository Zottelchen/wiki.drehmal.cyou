# Kiln of Virtuo

![[kiln.png]]

The **Kiln of Virtuo**, often referred to simply as the **Kiln**, is the most sacred place of the Goddess [[Virtuo]], located on a turquoise isle just to the west of [[Firteid]]. It is home to Virtuo's [[Devotion]] altar, several prominent smaller points of interest, custom merchants, and expansive lore books. The Kiln can be accessed either from the long bridge that connects it to Firteid in the east, or via its southern dock.

First entering the Kiln grants the "Pilgrim's Eye" advancement.

## Layout/Points of Interest

This section contains the major points of interest on the Turquoise Isle besides the main temple structure itself.

### Northeast

A large group of tents, occupied by religious pilgrims making trips to the Kiln, sits in the northeast of the isle, made up of various different wool colors. Two permanent wooden structures can also be found here: one knock-off lodge, and one building where the Kiln's attendants live. The latter building holds the [[Monk Gehru's Memoir]] book.

### Tree of the South

In the southeast, a massive acacia tree with pink wool/terracotta leaves towers over the island, with a shrine built inside it. This shrine holds the [[Tree Shrine Note]], which establishes that this tree almost certainly originated from the island of [[Sahd]]. A [[Runic Catalyst]] is found hanging from the tree's high branches.

### Docks

Several merchant stalls are located along the road down to the docks, and boats are found at the dock. An [[Untitled Books#Seeing Things At Sea|untitled book]] is found in the lower levels of the largest ship.

### Shop Buildings

There are several smaller buildings outside the main temple, in the Kiln district, which are more than a simple merchant stall. They are represented below.

#### Akhlo'Aroma

Akhlo'Aroma (The Taste of Dusps) is a light blue building built in the style of the houses in [[Dusps]], containing a restaurant run by the Duspian Ispin family. A "Waiter" merchant is found here, and the family residence is found below, containing the [[Youngster's Journal]] book.

#### Sniki Slipshear's Genuine Artifacts and Relics

Sniki Slipshear, a sleazy merchant who sells various souvenirs and artifacts related to the Kiln at very high prices, has a shop set up on the corner of the street in the Kiln district, next to the main plaza. There are several joke items with listed prices on signs on the walls, although these can simply be taken. Upstairs, Slipshear has a decently-sized reserve of gold.

#### Vir Spirits

Vir Spirits is a bar located along the southwestern side of the main path, with a "Bartender" merchant.

### Dynasty Hotel

Seemingly named after the [[Tidal Dynasty]], the Dynasty Hotel is the primary hotel on the Turquoise Isle. It does not contain a special Primal Cache room, but is the largest building on the island besides the Kiln itself.

### Grave of Pure Patrons

A large graveyard is located southwest of the Kiln, labeled with two signs which read "GRAVE OF PURE PATRONS" and "THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN". This area contains gravestones dedicated to some of the map's Patreon subscribers, who were canonically raptured in the [[Fall of Avsohm]]. 6 of their graves contain chests beneath.

### Divination Facility (Project ArkAngel)

The Divination Facility is located behind the Kiln of Virtuo, in a cavern. An [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] research facility attempting to utilize the latent magic energy around the Kiln, the Divination Facility is home to five lore books, all in item frames sitting on top of desks or countertops.

In order, these tell the story of the facility:

- [[Negotiation Notes]] details the negotiation between the author, [[Eleis|CSO Eleis]], and the [[Virmari]] Grand Pontiff Arjuni, as Avsohm sought approval to pursue their work at the Divination Facility, researching divine magic. <br>
- [[Project ArkAngel]] outlines the goal of the project, recounting the discovery of an anomalous object in [[Purity Peaks]] and the decision to try and "activate" it somehow by using the Kiln's high levels of ambient magic. <br>
- [[One Year Update]] was written after a year of work in the cave, with Avsohmic researchers having been locked inside for the entirety of this year. <br>
- [[Energy Cascade Achieved]] was written after a breakthrough, in which the energy cascade that the researchers had been chasing was finally achieved. <br>
- [[Final Activation]] appears to have been written during the [[Fall of Avsohm]], as the facility lost contact with the rest of the empire. Although ArkAngel was reportedly scheduled to be activated fully in under an hour, it seems that the destruction of the empire claimed the lives of the workers before this could be done.

Pressing the button near the entrance triggers the true final activation of this project.

??? warning "ArkAngel Activation"
    Activating the button triggers a long animation which spawns a [[Gates|quartz gateway]], similar to others found throughout the world. This structure is not fully active upon creation.

## Kiln

The Kiln of Virtuo is a very large temple facility, home to [[Virtuo]]'s [[devotion]] altar.

![[kiln_interior.png]]

The main room, accessed from the stairs to the south, is a massive circular chamber, centered around a deep pool. Four statues are built around the edges of the room, representing the highest-ranking members of Virtuo's Grand Parish: [[Vahid|Pontiff Vahid]], Abbess Elvihra, Adjudicator Diusahn, and the "Verdant Mistress".

### Karesh Signs

![[kiln_signs.png]]

Around the ground floor, there are four shrines in the four corners of the building. Between these rooms, there are other small builds. Most notably, to the southwest, there is a small quartz pillar which contains two signs, in parallel to the [[Burnt Palace#Tree Memorial Sign|signs in a memorial at the Burnt Palace]]. These signs read:

> May the memory of the Battle of Karesh fade faster than this pillar. <br>
> Death to Vorhan <br>
> Prosperity in the Bright Capital

This sign has been the subject of intense speculation within the lore community. It is heavily believed to be tied to the pre-[[Felling]] conflict between the [[Maelruhn]] and the [[Viruhn]], with the Battle of Karesh possibly being the conflict which burned down the [[Primal Tree]]. This battle is not referenced anywhere else in the map by name.

### Upper Level

Staircases along the western and eastern walls lead up to the higher-level balcony. The [[Artifacts#Countenance of Virtuo|Countenance of Virtuo]] artifact is found at the southern end here.

### Hidden Room

![[kiln_vroom.png]]

Inside the central pool, a single block in the western wall is made up of quartz rather than smooth quartz, giving it a faint outline. Digging through this block reveals a hidden set of rooms. 

A broken [[Gates|gateway]] is found nearby, which cannot be meaningfully interacted with.

A larger pool is found in this room, containing two axolotls named "Ada" and "Solos".

The main room here, is Virtuo's personal bedchamber, with a mural of her face over the bed. The [[Powerless]] book is found in this room.

### Virtuo Devotion Guide

![[kiln_shrine.png]]

Several low-level devotion offerings to Virtuo are found around her shrine in the front of the Kiln, but higher-level offerings must be found at statues of her form throughout [eastern Drehmal](/World/Regions/Eastern_Regions/).

Virtuo statues can be found throughout the east, including in [[Dusps]], [[Highfall]], [[Mossfield]], [[Firteid]], and elsewhere in the [[Black Jungle]].

Like all other devotion sites, the Kiln of Virtuo is home to a [[Trinkets#Relic Vessel|Relic Vessel]]. The Relic Vessel here is located at the southeastern corner of the island, beneath a small torii gate southeast of the large pink tree.

## Lore

The Kiln of Virtuo has likely existed for almost the entirety of the [[Virtuo|Goddess's]] life, having served as her base of operations and holiest site for effectively all of recorded history. Its signposts referencing the Battle of Karesh seem to imply that this structure was somehow founded by [[Viruhn]] survivors, who were once allied with the Bright Capital in what is now Eastern [[Xivrhynt]].

[[Drehmari]] followers of the Goddess made routine pilgrimages to the Kiln during Virtuo's 3000 years on Drehmal, often highlighted by a chance to see the Lady of the Mirror in person. She seems to have lived here for most of her life. The Kiln was heavily incorporated into the traditions of the people of [[Firteid]], including the Wellspring Day festivities. During the height of the [[Tide Queen]]'s paranoia, outside travelers were either heavily taxed or blocked from entering the holy site at all.

The Kiln was invaded by [[Maelihs]] at the end of the [[Tidal War]], an encounter in which Mael ripped out Virtuo's right eye and fashioned it into the shield [[Eyebiter]].

Following Virtuo's departure at the end of Av3, the Kiln saw a decrease in pilgrims, following the trend of people across the continent abandoning Virtuo worship. However, new members of the faith did step up to maintain the facilities, and it is still one of the more busy, lively areas in modern-day Drehmal.

## Extras

### Trivia

A player head made to resemble a plushie of Virtuo is hidden beneath the center of the carpets in her hidden underground room.

***

For Halloween 2023, the Kiln of Virtuo was redecorated to be Halloween-themed by a mix of devs and community members, with a custom soundtrack made for the event. A screenshot of the Halloween Kiln can be seen, along with the theme song, in this video by Drehmal composer Chris Nesja.

### Update History

The Kiln of Virtuo received possibly the single largest upgrade in [[Drehmal v22|the 2.2 update]], being expanded from a simple quartz structure with a pool to a much more intricate palace complex, as well as adding its trading district and the Divination Facility.
