# Terminus

![[Terminus.webp]]{ align=right width="300" }

**The Terminus** acts as the fast-travel hub for Drehmal. It contains a number of initially inaccessible teleportation rooms, which are linked to [[Towers|specific towers]] in all regions of the map with the exception of the [[Crimson Gorge]] and the [[Verdant Labyrinth]]. As players discover and activate towers, they will become available for use in the Terminus.

Discovering and linking towers to the Terminus contributes to [[story progression]].

The towers are split into four different categories, based on their position on the map.

## Central Towers

 - [[Capital Valley]]
 - [[Gulf of Drehmal]]
 - [[Palisades Heath]]

## Western Towers

 - [[Anyr'Nogur]]
 - [[Carmine]]
 - [[Casai]]
 - [[Ebony Veldt]]
 - [[Hellcrags]]
 - [[Lorahn'Kahl]]
 - [[Merijool]]
 - [[Mount Ebonfire]]
 - [[Nimahj Swamp]]
 - [[Tharxax Plains|North Tharxax]]
 - [[Tharxax Plains|South Tharxax]]

## Eastern Towers

 - [[Akhlo'Rohma]]
 - [[Black Jungle]]
 - [[Faehrcyle]]
 - [[Grand Pike Canyon]]
 - [[Heartwood]]
 - [[Highfall Tundra]]
 - [[Mael's Desolation]]
 - [[Purity Peaks]]
 - [[Spearhead Forest]]
 - [[The Frozen Bite]]
 - [[Veruhkt Plateau]]

## Island Towers

 - [[Island of Dawn]]
 - [[Island of Dusk]]
 - [[Sahd Island|Sahd]]
 - // ERROR //

As towers are unlocked, areas of the central Terminus map will have end rods placed, roughly marking each tower's location in it's region.
