The monastery can be found by following a path that begins at a spruce wood dock, on the eastern shore of the largest lake in Purity Peaks. This path winds through the woods and up the side of the mountain, guided by white lamppost-like structures and gateways.

## Layout

The monastery itself is a small settlement, home to a few La'Tehrmari, some of whom bear the name "Scalebound Priest". There are a few buildings on the lower level, including one with what looks to be a natural hot spring.

Further up the path, the player will come to two tall towers, connected by a bridge. A [[Fervor Stones#Stone of Luxury|Stone of Luxury]] is found in the first tower, in a chest along the wall, while the second tower contains a broken [[Gates|gate]] and a [[Runic Catalyst]] on the wall.

## Lore

Tehrmari are native to the moon of [[LD|Lo'Dahr]], and those who visit Drehmal often do so for the same reason: a mandatory year of service, preaching to and recruiting the [[Drehmari]] of the [[Disc]]. This was one of the temporary settlements for members of the Tehrmari clergy who were on this sort of missionary trip. However, in recent years, Tehrmari have dwindled in number, and they have become less strict about enforcing this custom.

As a result, this settlement has cut off contact with the rest of the Tehrmari, living among the Drehmari while simultaneously hidden on the mountaintop.
