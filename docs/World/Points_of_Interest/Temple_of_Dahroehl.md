# Temple of Dahroehl

![[temple_of_dahroehl.png]]

The **Temple of Dahroehl** is a temple built into a cliff face in northwestern [[Anyr'Nogur]], dedicated to the Aspect of Freshwater, [[Dahroehl]]. It contains two [[Runic Catalyst|Runic Catalysts]] and the [[Artifacts#Mirage|Mirage]] artifact as rewards for solving the [[Cryptic Ode]] puzzle found within.

## Design

The Temple of Dahroehl is carved out of the red sandstone walls of the canyon, taking clear inspiration from the real-life architecture of [Petra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra). Its exterior is decorated with ornate bits of blue and gold, and its interior is home to four rooms surrounding a central fountain.

## Puzzle

The puzzle at the Temple of Dahroehl is first hinted at by the [[Hastily-Left Message]] book, found on the ground in an item frame near the entrance. This book, left by a dying adventurer, reads:

> I don't have long to live. I finally found this temple. The monks should have left instructions about where to find the treasure in the small cave where that waterfall in the central room flows from. Do what I could not

Sure enough, swimming up the central waterfall, players will find another book under an off-colored block: the [[Cryptic Ode]]. This book provides a series of hints to finding the treasures here.

    Dahroehl, Water Wyrm
    
    How splendidly your scales must shine!
    
    With all the grace of a moonlit lake
    
    And not a hint of brine!
    
    Progenitor of morning dew
    
    No expense has been spared to honor you!
    
    Within this place there number three
    
    Artifacts of primal energy!
    
    Through your instruction, we thoroughly know
    
    That no place is free from the water's flow.
    
    Thus, so no outsiders who would poison springs
    
    Can find their way to these valuable things
    
    We shall provide only the smallest quantum of direction:
    
    When looking from a lower view
    
    Banners grace a rounded edge
    
    See their colors: orange and blue
    
    Hanging below the highest ledge!
    
    If a catalyst is what you seek to attain
    
    Do not halt or falter
    
    Look to the chamber marked with the sigil of rain
    
    Find the spring which feeds the altar!
    
    Next, return to the central room
    
    And find the symbol of a basin
    
    If you then look high
    
    At a reddened eye
    
    Your quest will swiftly hasten!
    
    Finally, return once more
    
    To our reverent temple's core
    
    Locate the flower and chalice of power
    
    To proceed in this order shall be your chore.
    
    In each of these rooms there hides one switch
    
    Within a shadowed nook
    
    Asymmetry will show you which
    
    Flow quickly betwixt them like a brook!
    
    Then return to the central pool to claim your final offering.
    
    Dahroehl, Water Wyrm
    
    We hope you visit soon
    
    Though we may be gone in a distant dawn
    
    Claim these treasures we have strewn!

The first two clues each pertain to a [[Runic Catalyst]]. These lines are:

> Look to the chamber marked with the sigil of rain
> 
> Find the spring which feeds the altar!
> 
> Next, return to the central room
> 
> And find the symbol of a basin
> 
> If you then look high
> 
> At a reddened eye
> 
> Your quest will swiftly hasten!

The first hint refers to the room with a raincloud symbol, on the far right. Climb up the spring in this room and through a series of tunnels to the top of the temple's exterior, where you can find a chest with a Runic Catalyst buried in the floor, at the southern end.

The second hint refers to the room with a basin/bowl symbol, on the far left. The "face" in the wall has two eyes, one glowing red and one blue. Climb up to the red one on the left and grab the catalyst from a chest in the bottom of this hole.

The final clue pertains to an artifact:

> Finally, return once more
> 
> To our reverent temple's core
> 
> Locate the flower and chalice of power
> 
> To proceed in this order shall be your chore.
> 
> In each of these rooms there hides one switch
> 
> Within a shadowed nook
> 
> Asymmetry will show you which
> 
> Flow quickly betwixt them like a brook!
> 
> Then return to the central pool to claim your final offering.

In the flower and chalice rooms (center-left and center-right, respectively), there is one "switch" each. These switches are actually buttons, both found low and hidden in small nooks. If you must, you can break other blocks to expose these buttons better. The button in the right-hand room is underneath one of the corners of the copper vase structure, at **(-3660, 36, 1985)**. The button in the left room is hidden in the wall behind a stair at the edge of the fountain, at **(-3665, 36, 2012)**.

Once you have located both of these buttons, you will need to press them in quick succession (within a few seconds of each other). Successfully doing so will destroy the buttons, and spawn a chest with the [[Artifacts#Mirage|Mirage]] artifact in the central pool.
