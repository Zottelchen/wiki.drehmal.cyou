![[espinor.png]]

**Espinor** is a small ruin in the eastern [[South Heartwood]], at the western end of a bridge to the Tidal town of [[Zovan]]. It was formerly the site of a sprawling Heartwood kingdom, but was destroyed in [[Maelihs|Mael]]'s Desolation of the South Heartwood.

Espinor is built on a hillside, primarily out of spruce wood and cobbled slate. To its south is the only surviving remnant of the original South Heartwood biome, a small swampy area with large banyan trees.

## Layout/Points of Interest

The large house near the western end of the hilltop holds a few chests. One of these, found underneath a chiseled stone brick on the upper floor, hides the [[Artifacts#Tidal Root Mask|Tidal Root Mask]] artifact.

A smaller house east of this one holds the [[A Bridge to Prosperity|A Bridge to Prosperity?]] book on its ruined upper floor.

In version 2.2.2, another artifact was added to this town: [[Artifacts#Last Breath of a Stargazer|Last Breath of a Stargazer]], on the top level of another house down the hill to the west.

## Lore

Espinor was once the center of a Heartwood kingdom (the Kingdom of Espinor), which was part of the territory annexed by [[Avsohm]] in their rapid late-Av2 growth. Under Avsohm's rule, Espinor was connected to the [[Tidal Dynasty|Tidal]] city of [[Zovan]] by a bridge across Vir's Strait, initially resulting in positive cultural and commercial exchanges between the two towns.

However, the fall of the empire and the growing paranoia of the [[Tide Queen]] eventually led to conflict with Zovan and the Dynasty.

Espinor was decimated by the [[Skullmother]]'s destruction of the South Heartwood near the end of the [[Dune Wars]].
