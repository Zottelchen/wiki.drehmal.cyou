    Approximate Coordinates: `341, 66, -85`

There is not much to be found in Fortahn, besides the [[Artifacts#Goh's Plate|Goh's Plate]] artifact in one of the houses. Its architectural style is Middle Avsohmic.

## Lore

Fortahn appears to have been a somewhat relevant location for the Empire overall, as [[Gohri Zed]] is suggested to have lived or worked there to some degree, possibly while working on [[avSYS]].

A book found in faraway [[Highfall]] provides a depiction of the town's grisly end during the [[Fall of Avsohm]], although it is not clear to what degree that work has been embellished.
