# Semehol

![[semehol.png]]

**Semehol** is a ruined town in [[South Tharxax]], just southwest of the [[Slime Island]]. Once a highly effective industrial town specializing in refining the slime from the nearby island, it was brutally destroyed by the forces of the [[Empire of Maelihs]] after its [[Drehmari]] population attempted a revolt against the Burnt Generals.

Today, the ruins of the town are found inhabited by hostile [[Maelmari]], just outside of [[Tharxax City]].

## Layout

Semehol straddles both sides of a river that leads from the Slime Island to the Tharxax Sea.

Immediately upon entering from the main road, players will find the [[Tattered Pamphlet]] book in the first ruined building on the left. A destroyed building on the right is full of skulls, likely indicating a mass grave. It holds a [[Runic Catalyst]].

Further into the town, the top floor of a house near the ruined Terminus tower holds the [[Tharhan A Land of Conquest (Chapter 4)|final chapter of Tharhan: A Land of Conquest]]. On the other side of this tower, a 1x1 hole in the ground reveals a quartz slab. Dig through it for another Runic Catalyst.

A green-topped building in the east is home to a Maelmari Berserker spawner, as well as the [[Artifacts#Sliming Trousers|Sliming Trousers]] artifact.

## Lore

The Drehmari inhabitants of Semehol were lorded over by the [[Empire of Maelihs]] for many years. Their primary industry was slime: slime mined from the [[Slime Island]] just to the northeast was refined here, then sent to [[Tharxax City]]. 

At some point in the relatively recent past, the workers of Semehol attempted to stage a rebellion against the [[Burnt Generals#Ethgar|Third Burnt General, Ethgar]]. They failed, and the entire Drehmari population of the town was slaughtered by his army.
