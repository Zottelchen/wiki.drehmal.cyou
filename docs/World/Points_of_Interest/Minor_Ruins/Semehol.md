# Semehol

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Semehol** is a ruined town in [[South Tharxax]], just southwest of the [[Slime Island]]. Once a highly effective industrial town specializing in refining the slime from the nearby island, it was brutally destroyed by the forces of the [[Empire of Maelihs]] after its [[Drehmari]] population attempted a revolt against the Burnt Generals.
