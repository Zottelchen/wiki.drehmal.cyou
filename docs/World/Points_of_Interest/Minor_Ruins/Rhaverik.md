# Rhaverik

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Rhaverik** is a ruined town on the northwest banks of a lake in the [[North Heartwood]], along the path from [[Capital Valley]] to [[Gozak]]. Its people were wiped out by a mining accident under [[Insohm|Insohmic]] rule, as the Order attempted to mine for [[rehntite]] beneath the surface of the settlement.
