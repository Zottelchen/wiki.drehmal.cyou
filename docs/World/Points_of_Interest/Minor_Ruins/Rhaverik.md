# Rhaverik

![[rhaverik.png]]

**Rhaverik** is a ruined town on the northwest banks of a lake in the [[North Heartwood]]. Its people were wiped out by a mining accident under [[Insohm|Insohmic]] rule, as the Order attempted to mine for [[rehntite]] beneath the surface of the settlement.

Some villagers remain in an inn and trading post just outside the ruins, where a short puzzle leads to a [[Runic Catalyst]].

## Ruins

The ruins of Rhaverik are situated on the northwestern edge of the large lake in the North Heartwood, along the clearing that leads from [[Capital Valley]] to [[Gozak]].

A small house in the south is home to one remaining Drehmari, as well as a chest with the [[Survivor's Account]] book.

To the north, there is a statue of [[Drehmal]], complete with an accepted [[devotion]] offering similar to the others throughout the central regions.

## Inn & Trading Post

To the northwest of the ruins is the Rhaverik Inn & Trading Post, home to an inn building and seven merchants. Each of them only has one trade, which ultimately converts 12 scales into a Runic Catalyst.

## Lore

Rhaverik was a prosperous Heartwood town in the Second and Third Avihms, although they were relatively exploitative of the land around them. During the reign of [[Insohm]], the Order discovered a small deposit of impure [[rehntite]] in the mines beneath the town. Pushing the residents to mine it, the over-mining eventually caused a cave-in, draining part of the nearby lake into the mines, collapsing buildings on the surface, killing up to thirty villagers. After that point, most of the townspeople left for other settlements.

## Extras

The "Ael Irien Dye" sold by one of the traders at the Trading Post seems to be an extremely niche reference to a possible alternative/original name for [[Virtuo]], only seen in this item and the [[Relics#Sprout of Anguish|maximum level Sprout of Anguish relic]].
