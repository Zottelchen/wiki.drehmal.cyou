## Layout

The majority of Eloa is a small walled town to the north, within a field of bamboo, where its common people would have lived. The only unique loot of note here is the [[Grim Notice]] book. The architecture here is strongly reminiscent of [[Mohta]].

A trail leads from the main town to a larger manor up the hill, the home of the noble family that once ruled it. Inside this house, players will find the [[Letter to Nobody in Particular]] book, written by the final head of the house, and the [[Artifacts#Sharksbane|Sharksbane]] artifact in an item frame above the triple bed.

## Lore

Eloa was a relatively prosperous town, exporting a substance known as yellowroot to the rest of the west.  The town was ruled by the noble House Ayre, a [[Tahva|Tahvan]] family, who lived in the large manor. However, its fortune would change when a [[Burnt Generals|Burnt General]] (likely Ethgar) arrived, forcing the town into the [[Empire of Maelihs]].

[[Vahid]] and [[Insohm]]'s successes in the [[Battle for Drehmal]] included liberating the people of Eloa, pushing Mael's forces back into [[The Carmine]], but the disappearance of the Grand Parish led to Insohm's overnight collapse at the end of Av3. Fearing the future of the town under Mael's influence, the people of Eloa dispersed to other neighboring settlements, including [[Mohta]], [[Tharxax City]], and even farther. The final leader of House Ayre, Helene Ayre, was the last person left in Eloa, and chose to flee to the east, leaving behind her manor. It is possible that this is how the current location of [[Tahva]] came into being, in the early Fourth Avihm.
