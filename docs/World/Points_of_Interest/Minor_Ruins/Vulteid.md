# Vulteid

![[vulteid.png]]

**Vulteid** is a ruined city just south of [[Firteid]]. In the Second Avihm, Vulteid was a sister city to Firteid, and even fought against the [[Tide Queen]]'s tyranny, but it stands in ruins today.

## Layout

Very few buildings remain standing in Vulteid, with most of the town seemingly having burnt down. It can be seen to have had a distinct style, heavily relying on uses of black and red, including a red and orange gate to the town similar to Firteid's blue main gate.

The [[Artifacts#Ash-Stained Battle Skirt|Ash-Stained Battle Skirt]] is found in the floor of a round building near the gate.

## Lore

Vulteid was once very close to Firteid, and was referred to as the "spiritual center" of the entire Black Jungle region at one point in Av2. Its inhabitants were known to participate in the traditions of [[Wellspring Day]] with the Firteidans. At the end of Wellspring Day, Vulteid would host the Living Archive, a long play that recounted the entire history of the realm (post-[[Felling]]) up until that point.

During the [[Tide Queen]]'s reign, relations between Firteid and Vulteid became much less peaceful. Vulteid's militia, known as the (1) Indomitable, were a formidable force that many residents of Firteid hoped would liberate them. From the fact that Vulteid stands in ruins today, this was clearly not how history unfolded.

1. Unclear if there is any tie to the [[Artifacts#Indomitable|artifact by the same name]] found in [[Faehrcyle]], or if this is coincidence.

The destruction of Vulteid is not explained, but it is very likely that the [[Tidal Dynasty]] played a role.
