Zovan's only notable loot is the [[Bloodwritten Curse]] book found in an item frame, on the ground in a ruined house.

## Lore

Zovan was initially a prosperous [[Tidal Dynasty|Tidal]] town, connected to the Heartwood town of [[Espinor]] across Vir's Strait to the west by a bridge during the time of [[Avsohm]]. Trade routes and cultural exchanges were established between the two sides, but relations soured over time. Espinor was destroyed by the [[Skullmother]]'s blast that caused the Desolation, and Zovan was sucked into the [[Tide Queen]]'s paranoia.

The town appears to have been destroyed by Gozaki Union forces during the [[Insohmic Civil War]].
