# Sal'Veruhkt

![[salveruhkt.png]]

**Sal'Veruhkt**, formerly known to its Veruhktian founders as **Veruhkaan**, is a ruined city along the southern end of the border between [[Akhlo'Rohma]] and the [[Veruhkt Plateau]]. Once the capital city of the highly advanced Veruhktian people, its inhabitants were crushed by military advances from Akhlo'Rohman political forces and eventually the [[Avsohm|Empire of Avsohm]], forcing the natives into hiding and destroying significant parts of the city.

Sal'Veruhkt is easily accessible from the path that leads between Akhlo'Rohma and the Veruhkt Plateau proper. It is not truly on the plateau itself, but it would likely be considered a part of the Veruhkt region due to its cultural history and the surrounding biome.

## Layout/Points of Interest

Sal'Veruhkt is a very advanced-looking ruin, with large towers made of gray, white and black that call to mind the image of real-life skyscrapers.

A [[Fervor Stones#Stone of Luxury|Stone of Luxury]] is found on top of one of these towers, in the east.

The [[Artifacts#Visionary's Crossbow|Visionary's Crossbow]] artifact is found on the top floor of the tallest tower.

## Lore

Sal'Veruhkt was founded by the Veruhktian people under the name **Veruhkaan**. They developed an advanced civilization centered around advanced technology that could locate and transport them to the hidden moon of [[Lo'Veruhkt]], but were colonized and forced out of their homes by the imperial forces of Akhlo'Rohma (likely [[Ancehl Castle|Ancehlians]] or [[Dusps|Duspians]]), and the city was later conquered by [[Avsohm]].

Avsohm appears to have used the city extensively, even as the native people were forced into hiding beneath the [[Altar of Insight]]. They would eventually send some of their children to the city now named Sal'Veruhkt to assimilate into the empire, one of whom was [[Gohri Zed]].

With the Veruhktians still in hiding at the time of the [[Fall of Avsohm]], the city's population may have all been killed or left for new population centers in the Third Avihm.
