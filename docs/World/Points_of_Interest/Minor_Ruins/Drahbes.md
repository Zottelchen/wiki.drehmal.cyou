# Drahbes

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Drahbes** was an ancient city-state in the northeastern [[Gulf of Drehmal]] which rose above its competitors in early Av2, becoming the dominant political power in the key region of Dreh'Noha. Its ruins, built overwhelmingly of granite, are home to the [[Artifacts#Ancient Crown|Ancient Crown]] artifact.

Drahbes may have been the precursor to Old Drabyel and/or the [[Chosen Kingdom]], which would eventually evolve into the realm-spanning [[Avsohm|Avsohmic Empire]].
