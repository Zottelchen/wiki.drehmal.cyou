    Approximate Coordinates: `-1075, 105, 5204`

## Layout

Sal'Lorahn lies just off the road that leads from [[Mohta]] to [[South Tharxax]], near the Lorahn'Kahl [[Terminus Network#Towers|tower]]. From sea level, a staircase built into the cliffside leads up to the ruin proper. The entire northern half of the town is leveled.

There are several buildings in Sal'Lorahn, including sculptures that depict the three moons of [[LD|Lo'Dahr]], [[Lorahn]], and [[Loruhn]].

A mostly-intact building near the center of the ruins holds the [[Artifacts#Marred Masterwork|Marred Masterwork]] artifact in its basement.

A lectern in a building on the western outskirts holds the [[Four Directions]] book, which hints at the existence of the [[Lorahn'Kahl#Necromantic Church|hidden church]] in the Moonspires.

## Lore

Sal'Lorahn was the capital city of the [[Tri-Moon Theocracy]], a powerful cult of [[necromancy|necromancers]] that formed a state in Lorahn'Kahl in late Av2.

The city likely fell to ruin after the Theocracy crumbled, when [[Avsohm]] assassinated its leaders.

## Extras

### Build Contest

Sal'Lorahn took third place in the [2021 Ruins and Remnants Build Contest](https://youtu.be/Aff9XZDNAFw?si=dLPi6XzacVkLnfrp&t=465), a competition held within the Drehmal community to create new ruined cities and remnants of ancient civilizations. The top three placers were added to the map in [[Drehmal v22|version 2.2]]. This build was submitted by the user "Burnt General".

The [[Lorahn'Kahl#Necromantic Church|Necromantic Church]] found in the Moonspires further west was included in the caves directly beneath this ruin in the original build submission, but this was changed by developers for 2.2.
