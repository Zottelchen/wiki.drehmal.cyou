# Sal'Anyr

![[sal_anyr.png]]

**Sal'Anyr** was a massive city sitting atop a mesa in western [[Anyr'Nogur]], which was destroyed by the [[Empire of Maelihs]] at the very beginning of the [[Dune Wars]]. Its ruins today are home to the region's [[Terminus Network#Towers|tower]], as well as the [[Emperor Anyr's Scepter]] legendary weapon.

## Layout

### Entering Sal'Anyr

The ruins of Sal'Anyr sit on top of a very tall mesa, approximately 120 blocks above the surrounding desert floor, with no remaining bridges to other parts of the desert highlands. The city can be reached through conventional methods such as towering or gliding from nearby mesas, but there are two built-in ways to reach the top from the desert floor:

- On the east-southeast face of the mesa, a small sandstone structure holds the [[Spelunker's Woes]] book and leads to a deeper cavern. Following this cave leads to an area with bunks and a rail, the latter leading up to the surface of Sal'Anyr. <br>
- On the north-northeast face of the mesa, there is a lime green bed positioned next to a campfire, just outside a crack in the wall. This crack in the wall leads to a long spiral staircase, which can be climbed (or dropped back down) to directly access the surface ruins.

### Tower

The Terminus tower is located at the eastern end of the city, built into a sandstone tower surrounded by a partially broken spiral staircase. 

### Missile Silo

In a ruin northeast of the tower, one piece of bright yellow concrete powder rests along the wall. Digging through this block and the sandstone beneath it leads to a hidden missile silo room beneath, containing a map of the surrounding region and a large missile.

A [[Runic Catalyst]] is found in this facility, on an iron trapdoor platform next to the missile.

### Other Books

The [[Archaic Transcript]], a book documenting the state of the city immediately after its fall to the [[Empire of Maelihs]] and the planning of the [[South Heartwood]]'s Desolation, is found just underground in a ruin south of the tower.

The [[Burnt Notes]] book, north of the tower, paints a brief picture of the general attitude towards [[Anyr|Emperor Anyr]] in the city.

### Tomb of Anyr

The Tomb of Anyr is the main feature of the ruins, a pyramid dominating the western half of the city. Its main entrance at ground level is partially buried in sand, and forks off in two directions. These two paths must be excavated, and lead to different rooms in the pyramid.

The left (southern) path leads to what appears to have been the personal living quarters of the noble Anyr family. This area includes the [[Troubles of Arawehn Anyr]] book and the [[Artifacts#Aegis of House Anyr|Aegis of House Anyr]] artifact in the main rooms. A banner hides a secret passageway leading down to a loot-filled tomb.

The right (northern) path leads upwards, through a red sandstone hallway and staircase. This descends into a room with a zombie spawner underneath a chiseled red sandstone block, with a trapped staircase rigged to shoot arrows when the tripwire is triggered. At the back of this room, digging through the chiseled quartz block in the wall leads to a more elaborate tomb structure, holding the [[Emperor Anyr's Scepter]] legendary weapon.

There is also a significant amount of loot at the top of the pyramid. Reminiscent of a vanilla desert temple, the floor at the top of the pyramid can be dug through to reach a room filled with treasure, including several gold, diamond, and scale blocks. However, the room is rigged with many, many pressure plates and five TNT blocks in the floor, arranged in the shape of an X. Therefore, digging through the roof at all can explode all of this loot. No special items are lost if this occurs.

The top of the pyramid also contains a staircase which connects to the northern path from the main entrance.

## Lore

Sal'Anyr was originally settled by [[Casai|Casain]] migrants in mid-Av2, around the time that they invaded Tharhan and waged war on the [[Six Tharhan Kingdoms]]. This city, a bustling mesa-top metropolis, was known as Azen'nath, and was a Casain stronghold in the region for centuries. 

However, like the vast majority of the continent, it would eventually fall under [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] rule in late Av2, and under Avsohmic nomenclature, it was called Sal'Iloh. House Anyr, a family of nobles, was appointed to rule over the region, and eventually turned the city from a hub of Casain spirituality and culture into a military-oriented stronghold, used as a strategic location to potentially wage war with the [[Empire of Maelihs]]. As the Anyr family grew more and more powerful, the locals began to resent them. Shortly before [[Anyr]] became emperor, while he was still an Avsohmic general, the family officially renamed the city to Sal'Anyr, in an attempt to assimilate the locals into Dreh'Nohan culture.

Emperor Anyr significantly shook up Avsohmic politics by moving his entire cabinet to Sal'Anyr, utilizing the Terminus system to travel frequently between Sal'Anyr and [[Av'Sal]] as his business required.

Immediately after the [[Fall of Avsohm]], with the empire's infrastructure crippled, [[Maelihs]]' first move was to launch an all-out assault on Sal'Anyr, the western stronghold of the empire. Utilizing the power of the [[Skullbeasts]], Mael's forces completely leveled most of the city, save for the tower and pyramid. The [[Maelmari]] occupied the city for some time, before being abandoned once again. When the player arrives, there is no life left in the ruins.
