![[Origin1.webp]]{ align=right width="300" }
The Hunting Party Crypt is the burial place of members of the Party, most notably Asrihk Clearbrook, Ehri Gahra and Gahwyn "The Serendipitous". Drenched in shadows and filled with monsters, it takes the form of a series of corridors, with murals depicting gods and various important events.
Its entrance is located in the North of the [[Capital Valley]] [region](/Regions), below a cliff.
