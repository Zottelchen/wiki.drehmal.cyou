![[black_jungle_library.webp]]{ align=right width="300" }

The Sahdan Monastery (no official name given) is a building on an island cliff off the southeastern coast of the [[Black Jungle]]. It looks to be a library, mainly filled with bookshelves. Two lore books here explain the relationship between the island of [[Sahd]] and the [[Tidal Dynasty]].

A Lotus Shaped Compass can be found in a chest in the center of the building, calibrated to a specific location. Its description reads: _A compass which mysteriously points to a [[Sahd|location across the seas...]]_

Two dated books are also found here: [[Av2 1360 - Prisoners]], which establishes that Sahd sent prisoners to the Black Jungle immediately after the collapse of the [[Empire of Vir]], and [[Av2 1753 - Envoys]], which shows that the [[Tide Queen]] decided to wipe Sahd from history for this past transgression, cutting them off from the mainland.
