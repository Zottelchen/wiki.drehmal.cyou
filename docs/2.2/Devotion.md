# Devotion

**Devotion** is a new system coming with 2.2 that aims at giving more value to random loot items and introducing powerful options for the offhand slot.

Devotion represents the relation with the player to one of the three main deities or some of [[the Aspects]]. Each of them has its own devotion altars and rewards.

When the player finds a devotion altar, they can offer items to the deity or Aspects that is worshipped there to improve their devotion. Each deity/Aspect has their own list of liked, loved, and adored items. The player will have to figure out what these items are through the environment around them or through trial and error. The area surrounding the altar often shows some of the liked items in item frames, and loved items can be figured out with the help of a nearby hint book. Offering a deity/Aspect something they like, love, or adore will move the player closer to a rank-up.

The first rank-up will grant a basic, unupgraded [[Relic]], that's specific to a deity/Aspect. Relics are a new item tier. When held in the offhand, they give stat bonuses or other benefits. Every three rank-ups will reward the player with an upgrade to your Relic. Other rank-ups grant themed items. For example, rank-up #1 grants a Relic, #2 is a themed item, #3 is another themed item, #4 is a Relic upgrade, #5 is a themed item, and so on. Each Relic has four tiers, from +0 to +3. Once the player fully upgrades their Relic, they will have maxed out their devotion and can no longer give offerings.
