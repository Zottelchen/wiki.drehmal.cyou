# Lore

Beyond the [[Story Progression|main story]] alone, Drehmal's world is richly populated with side content that deeply fleshes out its world, broadly categorized as lore. This section includes a significant amount of supplemental information found throughout the map, from a collection of every [written lore book](/Lore/Books/) to pages containing all of the known information on specific figures in the history of the realm.

Beware of spoilers throughout this section! This section aims to be a central resource for anyone who wants to get into the lore of this world, but it is always advised that you experience the map for yourself before looking extensively throughout the wiki. Individual pages and sections will be spoiler-tagged appropriately, but if you are still early in the experience, it's best to stay away from this section for the time being.
