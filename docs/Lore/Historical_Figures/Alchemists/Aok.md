# Aok

**Aok** (pronounced "ay-ock"), sometimes referred to with the titles "First of the Dead", "Last of the Living," or "The First Necromancer", was an ancient alchemist who lived in the first Avihm. Widely believed to be the first person in the realm to ever complete the [[Alchemy#Great Work|Great Work]], he is also credited as the inventor of [[necromancy]].

## Known References

Aok is extremely mysterious, being very poorly understood by modern Drehmari even within the universe of the game, and explicit references to him in the map are few and far between. This section will focus exclusively on what is concretely known about Aok, and nothing more.

### List

- [[Ancient Sacrament]]: A book found on the eastern coast of [[Lorahn'Kahl]], alongside the [[Artifacts#Lorahn Sacrificial Blade|Lorahn Sacrificial Blade]]. It invokes the name of Aok in a rite of unknown purpose. <br>
- [[Dear Aok]]: This book is found in a small shack outside of the [[Moonlight Sanctum]], and is written by an aspiring necromancer to Aok. Notably, it establishes the "First of the Dead" and "Last of the Living" titles, and refers to him as "the greatest necromancer to ever live". It also states that Aok had "the ability to transcend the fabric that protects us from the voice of space", almost certainly referring to the [[Veil]], and asserts that Aok was supposedly killed by a band of mercenaries in the First Avihm. This also very clearly connects Aok to the [[Tri-Moon Theocracy]], with him likely serving as an inspiration to this mid-late Av2 group of necromancers. <br>
- [[Dusty Tome]]: This book, written by [[Akim]], references Aok as the first to complete the Great Work, but states that Aok was unable to take the [[Alchemy#Ambition|final step]]. <br>
- [[The Great Work]]: This book at the [[Nimahj Alchemy Fortress]] mentions Aok (as "The First Necromancer") as one of two alchemists to ever complete the Great Work. <br>

## Late-Game Speculation and Possible Connections

!!! info "See [[Alchemy#Eidolic Whispers|Eidolic Whispers]] on the Alchemy page."

Although this is speculation, Aok is believed by many community members to be the source of the [[Alchemy#Eidolic Whispers|eidolic whispers]] heard throughout Drehmal. Aok is a being with power over death due to his masterful necromancy, making him a match for the position of "eidolon", and has also been known to transcend the Veil, planting him in the [[Nothing]]. The whispers are seemingly heard by the players inside of [[Mt. Yavhlix]], the location of Drehmal's tear into the Nothing.

Therefore, it is possible that the [[Mt. Yavhlix Dialogue]] comes from Aok, driving the player towards the Nothing and goading them into killing [[Tethlaen]]. If this is the case, Aok thanks the player after they kill Tethlaen, and is seemingly not heard from again.
