# Aok, The First Necromancer

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Aok** (sometimes referred to with the titles "First of the Dead" or "The First Necromancer") was an ancient necromancer living in late Av1, who is widely believed to be the first Drehmari alchemist to ever complete the [[Great Work]]. He did so through the invention of [[Necromancy]].

Aok is believed to play an extremely significant role in the lore and main story of Drehmal, particularly through his association with [[Khive|Mystic Elder Khive]] and [[The Nothing]].
