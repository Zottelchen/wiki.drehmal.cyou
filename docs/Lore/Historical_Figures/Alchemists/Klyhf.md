# Klyhf Him'lahk

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Klyhf Him'lahk** was a Drehmari alchemist who defected from [[Red Dawn]] shortly after the [[Fall of Avsohm|fall]] of [[Avsohm]] to work under [[Maelihs]] at the [[Burnt Palace]]. 

Him'lahk came very close to completing the [[Great Work]] by slowly gaining the Burnt Lord's trust and attempting to sacrifice him in a machine built within his very own tower of the palace, but his plan was ultimately foiled. Mael killed him, and razed his tower.
