**Ultva Utofal** and **Hovadchear Myrik** were the two founders of the [[Order of Insohm]], a kingdom union, that was unlike the [[Avsohmic Empire]], as the Avsohm were an empire with one source of law, while the Order of Insohm was a more loose union. They founded the order during the Third Avihm, year 560 after centuries of war between the two deities [[Virtuo]] and [[Maelihs]].

After Ultva and Hovadchear's death, they were turned into some sort of puppets by the [[Mythoclast]]. The duo appears as the final boss of the map in the postgame quest, and serve as the final challenge for the player before obtaining [[Mythbreaker]]. They are fought in [[The Court]].
