# Kahmas Tuhs

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Kahmas Tuhs** was an elite [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] general, and the head of [[Blue Exodus]]. He was frozen in temporal stasis at the [[Stasis Facility]], and his pod appears to have opened several years before the [Stasis Eight](/Lore/Historical_Figures/Stasis_Eight/). It is unclear if he is still alive somewhere in the realm.
