## History

Gohri was born as Gorui to the Veruhktian Tech-Priest Lakeivaa. A very bright child, she was sent to study in the capital of the empire of [[Avsohm]], as part of a plot by the oppressed Veruhktians to gain the technological knowledge they needed to escape the [[disc]] and reach the hidden moon of [[Lo'Veruhkt]]. Adopting a less obviously-Veruhktian name, "Gohri", she attended [[Av'Sal]] University and was supposed to return to her people with her new-found knowledge. 

However, Gohri became highly invested in her new life, forming close relationships with [[Thresa Vera]] and [[Baen Vehmil]] while at the university, developing a romantic relationship with the former. She eventually became one of the lead programmers in the creation of the [[avSYS]] AI, and was also a major founder of the [[Stasis Facility]]. It appears that she never returned to share her knowledge with her people, whether by choice or due to the [[Fall of Avsohm]].
