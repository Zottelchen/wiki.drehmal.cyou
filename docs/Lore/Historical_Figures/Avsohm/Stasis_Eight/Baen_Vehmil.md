## History

Details are not known on Vehmil's early life. His first chronological appearance is in [[A Retrospective]], where it is established that he was a runecarver and student at Av'Sal University around the time that [[Thresa Vera]] arrived there, just after [[Anyr]]'s coronation. He grew close to both Thresa and Gohri, and rose through the ranks of Avsohm's Department of Science during Anyr's tenure. 

Vehmil collaborated with many other prominent Avsohmic figures, such as Thresa, Gohri, and [[Vohski Ottis]], and reported directly to Emperor Anyr later in his career. Vehmil is known to have spent time at [[Sal'Mevir]] and the [[Ring Facility|Warp Ring Research Installation]], and was instrumental in the creation of the [[Stasis Facility]]. 

Vehmil came to strongly dislike Anyr as he worked with the Emperor more closely, seeing him as a conqueror who would use the empire's incredible technological discoveries to further exploit others.
