# Stasis Eight

The **Stasis Eight** are a group of eight [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] [[Drehmari]] who are released from temporal stasis at the beginning of the story, in the [[Stasis Facility]]. While this is not explicitly communicated in the map, the player technically is not their own character, but rather, assumes the mantle of whichever member of the Stasis 8 was assigned to the stasis pod they spawned in. This has no real impact on gameplay or the way that the story occurs for the player.
