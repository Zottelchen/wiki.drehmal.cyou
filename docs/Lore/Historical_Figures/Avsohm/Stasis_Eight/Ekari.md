Ekari is tan-skinned, with elegant antlers decorated in silver bands and purple gems. They stand at about 5'8" (~173 cm) tall. They dress in their signature color scheme of white and purple, and are depicted with a fur coat in some art.

## History

Ekari appears to have been the singular most famous artist in Avsohm, rising to prominence early in the reign of Emperor [[Anyr]]. Initially leaning towards abstract art, they capitulated to the new emperor's crackdown on this art style, and collaborated with the government on several architectural projects. Most notable among these projects was [[Sal'Mevir]], a distinct facility of quartz and purple.

Ekari was the pioneer of what would come to be known as the "High Avsohmic" architectural style which relies on this white/purple color palette, also seen in the [[Terminus Network|Terminus]] and its towers, some of the pipes around the world, and parts of other Avsohmic facilities.
