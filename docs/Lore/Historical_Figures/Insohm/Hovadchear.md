# Hovadchear Myrik

> - **Lifespan:** ??? - Av3 847
> - **Position:** Master of [[Insohm]] (c. Av3 500 - Av3 847)

**Hovadchear Myrik** (pronounced "ho-vad-cheer meer-ick"), often referred to mononymously as **Hovadchear**, was the co-founder of the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]] and one of its first two Masters, along with [[Ultva|Ultva Utofal]]. He ruled until his sudden disappearance in Av3 847, within [[Castle Hovadchear|his castle]].

## Early Life

Little is known about Hovadchear's early life, but he did have an adoptive father, Jihn'sim Myrik, buried in eastern Spearhead Forest. (1) It is possible that Castle Hovadchear was already in his adoptive father's family, but this is not established in-map.

1. Jihn'sim Myrik's grave is found in a patch of podzol and dense forest, at **(4187, 72, 604)**.

By the end of his life, Hovadchear was described as a master architect. He likely took interest in the subject from an early age.

## Master of Insohm

Hovadchear and Ultva founded the Insohmic Coalition together in [[Spearhead Forest]], centered around Castle Hovadchear as a base of operations and [[Mossfield]] as a capital city. As Master of Insohm, Hovadchear oversaw the entire Insohmic Coalition, driving its early growth by pivoting it to focus on airship travel.

Hovadchear is most often mentioned in regard to Insohm's foreign policy, especially in his relation to the [[Tidal Dynasty]]. Hovadchear was said to value transparency as a virtue, and took great issue with the extortionist and isolationist policies imposed on the southeast by the [[Tide Queen]]. It is possible that he gave the order for the Insohmic Whispers to infiltrate the Tide Palace and assassinate her in Av3 628, sparking the [[Tidal War]].

## Disappearance

In Av3 847, likely during the long [[Battle for Drehmal]], Hovadchear and his castle mysteriously disappeared off the face of the disc completely, leaving nothing but a large crater in southwestern Spearhead Forest. The true cause of his disappearance was never established.

A small memorial was erected in his honor at the northern edge of the crater.

## In-Game

At the crater of [[Castle Hovadchear]], players will find [[Hovadchear's Greathammer]], a very strong legendary weapon which breaks through armor and deals massive damage.
