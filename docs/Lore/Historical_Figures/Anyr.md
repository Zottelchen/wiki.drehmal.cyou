Uffeihl Anyr (imperial name: Anyr Kalkorahm Al'Drehn Avsohm I) was an [[Empire of Avsohm|Avsohmic]] aristocrat and general, and later the third and final emperor of Avsohm. He was installed as emperor in the wake of [[Ifeihl|Emperor Zorhis Ifeihl]]'s fall from power. Anyr was a compelling choice due to his military experience, particularly after perceived military failings by Ifeihl, and he quickly earned the support of most of the Avsohmic population, popularizing Centralist politics. Although the economy prospered and technology continued to rapidly advance under his rule, the government was also made more authoritarian and freedom of speech was sometimes repressed. Anyr's reign and life were cut short by the abrupt events that caused the empire's fall.
