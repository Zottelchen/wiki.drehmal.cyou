**Amohn Aihura** was the [[Tehrmari]] champion of [[Palaesida]], Aspect of Storms. Serving as a warrior beside his patron Aspect, Amohn was a fabled hero of the [[Divine Schism]], known for his two signature weapons, [[Artifacts#Shock|Shock]] and [[Artifacts#Awe|Awe]], which can be found as artifacts in the map, as well as his signature chestplate, [[Thundercrux]], a legendary piece of armor.

## Known History

Amohn Aihura was a [[Tehrmari#La'Tehrmari|La'Tehrmari]] warrior and Palaesida's champion, likely ascended by the Aspect of Storms himself after becoming his greatest mortal friend. He was described as "equally impetuous and brave" as the Aspect.

Amohn's battle prowess was fully on display in the First Battle of Ytaj, in which he helped to defeat the forces of [[Sereven]] and capture the commander, holding Ytaj for the Palaesidans. He died in the Second Battle of Ytaj, reportedly killed by [[Kungahs]], the Hateful Blade.

After his and Palaesida's deaths in this battle, they were buried separately. Nonetheless, Amohn's chestplate, [[Thundercrux]], found its way to Palaesida's remains at the Heart of the Tempest.
