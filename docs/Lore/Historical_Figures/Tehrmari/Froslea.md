**Froslea** was the founder and first Benefactor of the [[Tehrmari#Wingmakers|Wingmakers]], the La'Tehrmari recruiting and missionary branch.

Froslea is mentioned in [[The Founders]] as having been a friend to the Wind Aspect [[Rihalae]], possibly drawing inspiration for the Wingmakers' mission from that Aspect's penchant for realm-wide travel.

Froslea may be deceased, as she does not currently hold the title of Benefactor, as this now belongs to Benefactor Zabuyah in Ytaj.
