**Kungahs**, also known as "The Hateful Blade", was a [[Tehrmari]] responsible for the murder of [[Tehra]] and [[Amohn Aihura]], among others. For his crimes, he was sentenced to death by captivity in Okhran Prison, in [[Palaesida's Domain]], as shown by the [[Notice of Punishment]] book.

From his title and his murder of Amohn Aihura, it could be extrapolated that Kungahs was a disciple of [[Maen]], the Aspect of Pain also strongly associated with hate.

It is stated that Amohn Aihura died at the Second Battle of Ytaj, in the conclusion to the [[Divine Schism]], meaning that he and Kungahs likely had a duel here. No other information on Tehra's death is found in the map.
