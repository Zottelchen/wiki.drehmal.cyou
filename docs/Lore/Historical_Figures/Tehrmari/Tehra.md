**Tehra**, often referred to with the title "First of the Tehrmari", was the founder of the La'Tehrmari (particularly, of the Scalebound Priests). She likely held the title of Scalespeaker, living at Naharja.

## Known History

Tehra was the first of [[The Founders]], the very first La'Tehrmari ascended by the Aspects. She was granted ascension particularly for her close friendship with [[Moen]], Aspect of Pleasure. As the ruler of the Scalebound, Tehra was functionally the leader of all Tehrmari during her lifetime.

Tehra is stated to have been killed by [[Kungahs]], the same warrior who is implicated in the death of [[Amohn Aihura]]. No other details on her life are known.

Tehra was the owner of the [[Artifacts#Equinox|Equinox]] artifact.
