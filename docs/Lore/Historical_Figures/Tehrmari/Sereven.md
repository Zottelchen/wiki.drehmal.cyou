**Sereven** was the founder and first Commander of the [[Tehrmari#Talon|Talon]], the La'Tehrmari equivalent of a police/military force.

## Known History

Sereven was the second of [[The Founders]] of the La'Tehrmari orders, ascended due to his close friendship with [[Nahyn]], Aspect of Mountains. He came to lead the "peacekeeping" faction of the La'Tehrmari, the Talon, and attained the title of Commander.

Sereven was a major player in the [[Divine Schism]], leading a charge on behalf of the Loyalists/Anti-Palaesidans to capture [[Ytaj]] from [[Palaesida]], known as the First Battle of Ytaj. This failed, and Sereven was kept hostage for several years. Freeing Sereven was one of the largest motives that drove the anti-Palaesidan cause, leading to recruitment of [[Blue Exodus]] operatives and eventually culminating in the Second Battle of Ytaj.

Sereven survived this battle, and was freed again. After the Schism, he and his Talon appear to have started acting with much greater prejudice against the Ro'Tehrmari.

At one point, an event known as "Sereven's Coup" took place, a massive purge carried out by the Talon against Ro'Tehrmari, particularly those aligned with [[Arkeje]] and [[Rohei]]. It is possible that one of the visions in [[The Augury]] depicts this coup, in which Sereven appears to kill Malka Gorrhys, the leader of Arkeje. This act of violence was deemed unacceptable by the Prismatic Council, who responded to Sereven's actions by creating the Moonsworn, [[Yriel]]. 

Yriel's first act as Moonsworn was cutting down the Talon in Ytaj, murdering dozens of Talon officers. Sereven is known to be dead now, and it is likely that this is where his life ended.
