**Yriel Rezhad**, also known as the **Moonsworn** and often referred to mononymously as **Yriel**, was the first and only dedicated servant of the Prismatic Council.

Bearing the title of Moonsworn, Yriel acted as the mortal servant and enforcement arm of the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/), interfering in mortal affairs when the Aspects did not wish to do so themselves.

Yriel famously wielded a mythical weapon, an [[Syzygy|extremely powerful crossbow]] which they used to cut down an untold number of the Aspects' enemies.

Yriel was active for an unknown period of time, and was killed at the [[Battle for Drehmal]] in Av3, likely by [[Vahid]].

## Known History

During [[Sereven]]'s coup, the Prismatic Council determined that the Talon, and the La'Tehrmari at large, had gone out of line, enacting systemic purges against their mortal Ro'Tehrmari counterparts. With the Aspects almost exclusively maintaining a policy of non-interference with mortal affairs, they came up with the Moonsworn as a workaround.

Yriel was selected as the Aspects' servant, the single person whom they could control mortal affairs with. To help them carry out the Elder Will, the Aspects granted Yriel [[Syzygy]], a weapon of mythical power.

Yriel's first act was to wipe out Sereven's top Talon officers at Ytaj, possibly also killing the Commander himself. This act effectively decimated the Talon's forces, allowing the Ro'Tehrmari to leave hiding and sending a clear message to Lo'Dahr that this kind of prejudice would not be tolerated. Yriel was hailed as a hero by some Ro'Tehrmari, although others saw them as just another enforcer that could hurt them.

Yriel's other exploits are not known, nor is it clear how long they were in the Aspects' service. It is stated, however, that they died in the climax of the [[Battle for Drehmal]], likely meaning one of the final battles at the end of Av3, and that they were "butchered by a falsely-pure fanatic of Virtuo". This description, plus a testimony from [[Monk Gehru's Memoir]], suggests that it was [[Vahid]] who killed Yriel.

Following Yriel's death, the Aspects did not create another Moonsworn. However, it seems that the player's completion of the six trials means that the Aspects have deemed them worthy of the Moonsworn's weapon, and that they possibly intended for us to serve them in the same manner.
