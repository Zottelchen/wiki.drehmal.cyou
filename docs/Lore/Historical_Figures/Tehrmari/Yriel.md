# Yriel Rezhad

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Yriel Rezhad**, also known as the **Moonsworn** and often referred to simply as "**Yriel**", was the first and only dedicated servant of the Prismatic Council.

Bearing the title of Moonsworn, Yriel acted as the mortal servant and enforcement arm of the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/), interfering in mortal affairs when the Aspects did not wish to do so themselves.

Yriel famously wielded a mythical weapon, an [[Syzygy|extremely powerful crossbow]] which they used to cut down an untold number of the Aspects' enemies.

Yriel was active for a period spanning at least several centuries, and was killed at the [[Battle for Drehmal]] in Av3, likely by [[Vahid]].
