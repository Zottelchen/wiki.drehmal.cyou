--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Oriann** (pronounced similar to "Orion"), also known as **Dragon Rider Oriann**, was a Ro'Tehrmari champion of the Sky Aspect [[Rihelma]]. Famed as the only mortal to ever truly befriend the eccentric Star-Rise Drake, she was known to have ridden on Rihelma in battle during the [[Divine Schism]].

Oriann is laid to rest in the [[Augural Tangle]], and was the owner of the [[Aeongale|legendary pair of leggings]] found in that location.
