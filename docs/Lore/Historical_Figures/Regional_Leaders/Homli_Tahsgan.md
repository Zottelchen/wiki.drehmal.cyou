# Homli Tahsgan

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Homli Tahsgan** was a Faehrcylian tribesman, and an incredibly powerful arcanist. In a conflict between his forces and those of [[Avsohm]], who sought to harness the power within [[Mt. Yavhlix]], Homli pushed back the southern invaders by triggering a colossal blizzard. This event and its impact would come to be known as the [[Frostfang Catastrophe]], an ecological disaster that affected nearly a third of Drehmal.
