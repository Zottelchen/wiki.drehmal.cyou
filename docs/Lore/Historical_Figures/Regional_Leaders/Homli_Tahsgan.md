**Homli Tahsgan** was a ruler of the [[Faehrcyle|Faehrcylian]] Falcon Clan, and an incredibly powerful [[Arcanism|arcanist]]. In a conflict between his forces and those of the [[Avsohm|Avsohmic Empire]], who sought access the power within [[Mt. Yavhlix]], Homli pushed back the southern invaders by triggering a colossal blizzard. This event and its impact would come to be known as the [[Frostfang Catastrophe]], an ecological disaster that affected nearly a third of [[Overworld|Drehmal]].
