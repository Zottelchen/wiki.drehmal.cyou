# Athrah Zarha

**Athrah Zarha** was the founder and first emperor of the [[Casain Empire]].

## History

Athrah Zarha was a skilled warrior from the southern Zarha tribe in mid-Av2, when [[Casai]] was made up of many independent tribes. In Av2 1189, he began attempts to unify Casai under a single banner, and founded the city of [[Athrah]] in northern Casai to serve as the center of his future empire.

Over the coming decades, Athrah led a series of conquests, annexations, and alliances to bring every other Casain tribe under his rule. The final clan to be absorbed into the empire was the far northern Clan Xorha. In Av2 1255, Zarha's forces fought and defeated Clan Xorha, but Athrah Zarha himself was killed in the battle, never fully seeing a complete Casain Empire.
