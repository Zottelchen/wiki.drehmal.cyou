# The Tide Queen

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

The **Tide Queen** (real name unknown) was the ruler of the [[Tidal Dynasty]] in the [[Black Jungle]] for several centuries, overlapping with both the Empire of [[Avsohm]] and the Order of [[Insohm]]. 

History broadly considers her a tyrant today, pointing toward her repression of her own people, isolationist policies, and war against the people of [[Sahd]], effectively cutting the island off from the rest of civilization centuries before the player awakens from stasis.
