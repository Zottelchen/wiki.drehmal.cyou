# The Tide Queen

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

The **Tide Queen** (real name unknown) was the ruler of the [[Tidal Dynasty]] in the [[Black Jungle]] for several centuries, overlapping with both the [[Avsohm|Empire of Avsohm]] and the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]. 

History broadly considers her a tyrant today, pointing toward her repression of her own people and isolationist policies. She was also responsible for the erasure of [[Sahd]] from the knowledge of the general public, effectively cutting the island off from the rest of civilization centuries before the player awakens from stasis.
