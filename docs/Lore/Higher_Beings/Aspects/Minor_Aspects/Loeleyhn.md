Loeleyhn has a room in [[Ytaj]], a small tower next to [[Loe]]'s room.

The tablets in Palaesida's room tell the story of the [[Divine Schism]] and how it was tied to the [[Frostfang Catastrophe]], heavily implicating Loeleyhn in the incident. Loeleyhn was one of three young Aspects, alongside [[Palaesida]] and [[Rihalae]], who schemed to steal the [[Frostfang]] from the Soletta. Loeleyhn distracted Loe with a flurry of snow, allowing Palaesida to steal the Frostfang and gift it to [[Homli Tahsgan]]. Homli would later use the Frostfang to cause the massive magical blizzard known as the Frostfang Catastrophe, permanently freezing over the north.

Following the Catastrophe, [[Faehrcyle]] transformed from a cold, but inhabitable plain to a frozen wasteland, massively expanding Loeleyhn's territory. She was initially ecstatic, but the loss of Faehrcyle resulted in [[Noha]]'s death due to grief. Loeleyhn does not make any significant appearances in the history of the Schism after this point.
