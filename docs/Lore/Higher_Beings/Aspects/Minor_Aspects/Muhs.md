# Muhs

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Greatbeast Muhs** was the Aspect of Beasts. Created by [[Vayniklah]], he was a giant beast responsible for the creation of all manner of other creatures, both beneficial to [[Drehmari]] (such as cattle) and harmful (such as Grasswolves). He was slain by a mortal [[Hunting Party]] in Av2, significantly increasing tensions between the Aspects and Drehmari, and contributing to the Aspects' decreased role on Drehmal.
