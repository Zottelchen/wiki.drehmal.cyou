### Color/Build Scheme

Rihalae's colors seem to be blue and purple, similar to her mother. Builds referencing Rihalae are often open to the air.

## In-Map References

Rihalae is one of the least-commonly mentioned Aspects. [[Plea to the Wind]] is one book written about her, located at a [[North Heartwood]] shrine to the Aspect of Wind, referring to her as the "great wanderer". This book implies that like the wind itself, Rihalae travels all over the realm, and has not been here in a long time.

[[Brewmaster Ga'ran's Diary]] corroborates this idea, stating that "Rihalae teaches us to spread as far as the wind carries us".

Rihalae does not have a domain on Lo'Dahr, and it is not clear if she has a room in [[Ytaj]] either.

There are, however, some more brief references to the Aspect of Wind on the moon, such as the [[Plea to Rihalae]] book in [[Rihelma's Domain]] and the statement that she was worshipped by [[Oriann]] early in her life. Rihalae is also stated to have been a friend of [[Froslea]], the founder of the Wingmakers.
