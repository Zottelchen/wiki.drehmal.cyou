## Description

Noha's passage in [[Theogony Volume III]] reads:

> Noha of Meadows, Aspect of Harvest
> ***
> Noha was a gentle giant, blessing the lands with nutrition. Died of grief, starting the Divine Schism.

Noha is believed to have been one of the physically largest Aspects, if not the single largest. She is depicted as gentle and kind, caring for her lands and its inhabitants, animals and [[Drehmari]]. 

The Aspects' family tree mural depicts Noha as a direct descendant of [[Taihgel]], the Aspect of Land, and [[Vayniklah]], Aspect of Life. This makes Noha one of only two Aspects to functionally have two Aspect parents, along with [[Palaesida]].

### Color/Build Scheme

Noha's colors are green, yellow, and blue, depicting a meadow with flowers and the sky above.

## Role

Noha is written in Theogony to have "bless[ed] the lands with nutrition", acting as a harvest god. She seemingly took an active role in tending to the fertile lands of Drehmal, considering all of the realm's meadows and plains to be under her protection and blessing.

## In-Map References

Two artifacts in [[Akhlo'Rohma]] reference Noha: [[Artifacts#Soilsplitter|Soilsplitter]], found in Esipelli Vineyard, is a hoe that was given to the vineyard's founder by Noha, and [[Artifacts#Staff of Xenoh|Staff of Xenoh]] is a shovel found along the Resting River in a large wooden structure, once belonging to another friend of Noha.

The vast majority of Noha's lore is found on [[Lo'Dahr]], where she spent most of her life and died. In fact, her corpse can be found in the map, collapsed in the center of [[Noha's Domain|her domain]] in the far east.

> The town of Lajani, built around Noha's skeleton.

From her skeleton, we can see approximately what Noha looked like. She was almost as large as the town itself, and has a skull somewhat reminiscent of a horse skull. She was a massive hoofed quadruped, with a scythe-shaped tail and spikes along her spine similar to a Stegosaurus. She had long, curved horns like a ram. Noha's horns and spikes are made out of tuff and deepslate lapis lazuli ore, a material known to hold significant magical powers within the universe of Drehmal. Her spikes also have a leaf pattern.

Noha's Domain outside of this small village is actively decaying, once a lush steppe but now corruptedâ€”filled with dead grass, hostile creatures, and bizarre obelisks.

Many more details around Noha's death are also revealed in Lo'Dahr, particularly through the information on the [[Divine Schism]]. The tablets in [[Palaesida]]'s room in [[Ytaj]] tell the story, painting Noha as a wise, older Minor Aspect. She considered [[Faehrcyle]], a cold but livable plain, to be a part of her domain, and its loss in the [[Frostfang Catastrophe]] caused her such grief that she died. Sources conflict on whether she literally "died of grief", as one suggests that Noha took her own life after the Catastrophe, and her death shocked the Aspects so much that they broke out into war over it.

End-game content also establishes that Noha was the first Aspect to notice the sudden appearance of [[Mt. Yavhlix]], informing others of bizarre mutations to the region's wildlife.
