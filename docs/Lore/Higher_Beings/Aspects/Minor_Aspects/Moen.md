## Description

Moen shares a passage in [[Theogony Volume III]] with her two siblings:

> Maen, Moen, and Tethlaen, the three Aspects of Emotion
> ***
> Created and maintain the Primal Emotions, all three of which are vital for functional souls. Moen lives on Lo'Dahr, Maen is shackled to Loruhn, and Tethlaen is widely believed to be dead after disappearing.

Moen is characterized as being extremely pleasant and friendly, in line with her domain.

### Color/Build Scheme

Moen is heavily associated with pink, magenta, red, and white. Designs concerning Moen often utilize heart patterns.

## Role

Moen tends to the Primal Emotion of Pleasure, and based on the way that Maen and Tethlaen are described, likely has some kind of power over how much of it people experience. She is also revered as a god of love.

## In-Game References

Moen was worshipped by the Dahe Clan, one of the three clans in ancient [[Sahd]] that each followed a member of the Emotion Trio. Their influence was mostly found in northwestern Sahd, and they were targeted by the Maen-worshipping Osaigah clan to the south.

[[Moen's Domain]] is a central region of the moon, the first place that players will find themselves after completing the [[Aphelion]] sequence. It is home to the city of [[Naharja]].

> The two statues of Moen in Naharja.

Naharja is a predominantly Moen-worshipping town, and holds two statues that seem to depict the Aspect's form. This form resembles a pink and white fox-like creature, reminiscent of sphinx statues.

It is unclear if Moen has a dedicated room in [[Ytaj]], although she may have a claim to two different rooms in the western wing. The book [[O Tethlaen]] was likely written by Moen, showing her close bond to her sibling Tethlaen.

[[The Founders]] asserts that Moen was a close friend of [[Tehra]], the first [[Tehrmari]], possibly indicating that Moen was significantly involved in the first creation of Tehrmari from Drehmari.
