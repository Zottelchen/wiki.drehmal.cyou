## Characteristics

Nahyn's passage in [[Theogony Volume III]] reads:

> Summit-Drake Nahyn, Aspect of Mountains
> ***
> A perfectionist who compensates for his small size by creating large landforms.

Nahyn's exact size is unclear, but he is at least smaller than the other Aspects, possibly being more comparable to a [[Drehmari]].

He seems to be a clear parallel to [[Noha]], as their domains (Mountains and Meadows) are natural opposites, while he is very small and she is possibly the single largest Aspect.

## In-Map References

There are very few clear references to Nahyn in the map, although the people of [[Wokonori]] are said to have once worshipped him as part of the trio of earth-related Aspects (alongside [[Koh]] and [[Taihgel]]).

Most of the Nahyn references come on [[Lo'Dahr]], where Nahyn has a prominent [[Nahyn's Domain|domain]] near the center of the moon. He also has a large room in eastern [[Ytaj]], pictured below.

Nahyn's domain is home to the only [trial](/World/Late-Game/Points_of_Interest/Trials/) not given by a Major Aspect, at the [[Hypogean Labyrinth]]. 

Nahyn is stated to have been a close friend of [[Sereven]], one of the [[Tehrmari]] founders.
