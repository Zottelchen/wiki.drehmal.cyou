**Mari The Great** is the Aspect of Drehmari, responsible for the [[Drehmari]] mind and representative of much of their early culture. He was believed to have walked among the Drehmari for much longer than the other Aspects, and is rumored to still be somewhere on Drehmal, with pertinent ties to [[Sahd]].
