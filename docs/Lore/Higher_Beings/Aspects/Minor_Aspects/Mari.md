# Mari

**Mari** is the Aspect of Drehmari. He was believed to have walked among the Drehmari for much longer than the other Aspects, and is rumored to still be somewhere on Drehmal, with pertinent ties to [[Sahd]].

The statue above, from the [[Emperor's Estate]], is the only known depiction of Mari's physical form in the map. Based on this statue, Mari is perhaps the singular most humanoid Aspect.

Mari is extremely wise and patient, and has historically been among the most active Aspects on the [[disc]].

### Color Scheme

Mari's color scheme is green, red, and yellow, often with the yellow in the center of a more elaborate pattern.

### Name

Mari's name is a [[Rihselch]] word which roughly translates to "creation".

## Role 

As the Aspect of Drehmari (functionally a god of people, equivalent to an Aspect of Humanity), Mari's role seems to be complicated. It is stated in Theogony that Mari helped to create the [[Drehmari]] form itself, although Drehmari are believed to have originally been creations of the [[Primal Tree]]. It has been proposed by community members that Mari's role in the creation of Drehmari was more to do with the Drehmari mind and culture, which is not clarified but would line up with his official characterization in the map.

What is clear is that Mari has spent a significant amount of time among mortals, particularly living in [[Sahd]]. He is referenced in many historical accounts on the island of Sahd, and seems to have become a spiritual and religious leader for its peoples, following the dissolution of their three original clans. This has led to a new syncretic religion in Sahd known to its followers as "The Path", which emphasizes thoughtful use and study of the three Primal Emotions, ultimately seeking to understand the unseen inner workings of the universe, just as Mari supposedly has. 

Mari appears to have been an important figure for the people of Sahd, not only as a worshipped Aspect but as a mentor figure who spoke directly with mortals. This seems to go beyond just the Drehmari, as Mari has also been recorded interacting with [[Neverdawn]].

Mari takes a clear interest in documenting the culture and history of mortal civilization, being among the most well-learned beings in the realm. 

## In-Game References

Mari is referenced frequently on the island of [[Sahd]], mostly around [[New Sahd]] (where a significant building is named after him) and [[Morah]], where he once resided (and possibly still does). The three books in the series "The Path" near Morah give an outline of the religion's core beliefs, with [[The Path Part 3 Eternal Enlightenment|Part Three]] carrying the only explicit mention of the Aspect in these books:

> Perhaps the wisest individual in all of Sahd is Mari, the Laughing Dragon himself. By seeing all there was to see of the pain, pleasure, and fear of Drehmari in his travels throughout the realm, he managed to find such wisdom that he has managed to live entirely within the daytime of the world after glimpsing the arc of twilight.
>
> It is our duty to follow his example and find a way to become truly eternal. By achieving great wisdom, we can follow Mari's lead and forever continue our journey of discovery. Only then will we truly begin to make progress along the Path of Enlightenment. One day, we too shall glimpse the arc of twilight and know all there is to know.

In Morah, a large house is the former (and possibly current) home of Mari, although he cannot be directly interacted with or found in any way. This home contains the [[Artifacts#Casain Theater Mask|Casain Theater Mask]] artifact, one of Mari's personal possessions.

> Mari's room in Ytaj.

Mari has one of the most interesting rooms in [[Ytaj]], filled with various trinkets and collectibles, a [[Simple Haiku|book written by him to his Sahdan followers]], what looks to be a fragment of the [[Black Jungle]]'s [[Verrhys]] statue, the [[Biography of Dragonrider Oriann]] book, a [[Other Creatures#Kohlohmah|Kohlohmah]] skeleton, and the [[Artifacts#Frontier's Edge|Frontier's Edge]] artifact.

Mari is also referenced in influencing the departure of [[Virtuo]] by informing her of suffering peoples at the edges of the realm in [[Xivrhynt]]. This served as the primary inspiration for Virtuo to leave the central continent, ending the Third Avihm, and also shows that Mari is aware of events in Xivrhynt. Based on the fact that he has visited the realm of [[Neverdawn]] as evidenced by the Frontier's Edge, it is possible that he has also been to post-[[Felling]] Xivrhynt.
