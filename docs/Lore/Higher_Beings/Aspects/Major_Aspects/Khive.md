# Khive

**Khive** is the Aspect of Magic. One of the four Elder Aspects alongside [[Rihelma]], [[Dahr]], and [[Taihgel]], Khive is often considered the most powerful of the Aspects due to his ability to directly control [[Primal Energy]].

Khive is perhaps the single most-discussed and most thoroughly characterized Aspect in the map.

## Description

Khive's passage in [[Theogony Volume II]] reads:

> Mystic Elder Khive, Great Arcane Aspect
> ***
> Khive is the Great Aspect who created Runic Magic, and gifted the power of the arcane to mortals. Considered the most powerful Aspect, Khive strictly stays out of the affairs of Drehmari. Few have ever seen his visage.

Khive is depicted as very wise and powerful, but reclusive, cautious, and distrustful of the [[Drehmari]].

Khive's physical form resembles a large lizard, similar to a bearded dragon.

### Color/Build Scheme

Khive is very heavily associated with the color yellow, as well as the flarepod (shroomlight) block. His builds often utilize a yellow and black color scheme.

## Role & Powers

Khive's powers are the most clearly outlined of the Aspects. As the Aspect of Magic, he is able to directly harness the power of [[Primal Energy]], capable of using it in its raw forms as a generic form of laser-like energy in combat. However, Khive is not able to access any of the specific applications of this energy: he cannot harness the power of lightning or create thunderstorms like [[Palaesida]], he cannot use the primal energy to create mountains like [[Nahyn]], and so on.

Khive is responsible for granting the other Aspects access to the powers of Primal Energy, creating channels for the energy to flow from his personal stockpile to the Aspects, and therefore powering all of the others. Similarly, he taught the rules of magic to mortal [[Drehmari]] in Av1, creating runic magic to allow the mortals to magic in small amounts. 

## Devotion Guide

Khive's [[devotion]] site is the small ruined town of [[Ihted]] in eastern [[Capital Valley]].

The devotion altar itself is located at the top of the ziggurat, surrounded by low-level offerings: primal pearls, books, and chiseled blocks of all types. The nearby hint book, [[Mercenary's Resignation]], suggests that the pertinent information would be contained in brewing stands, and that they have found nothing above ground.

Several brewing stands in the underground portion of Ihted do, however, contain higher-level offerings for Khive's devotion.
