**Mystic Elder Khive** is the Aspect of Magic. One of the four Elder Aspects alongside [[Rihelma]], [[Dahr]], and [[Taihgel]], Khive is often considered the most powerful of the Aspects due to his ability to directly control [[Primal Energy]].

Khive takes a physical form resembling something between a chameleon and a frog.
