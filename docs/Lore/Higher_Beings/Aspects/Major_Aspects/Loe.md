**Loe** is the Aspect of Cold, and one of the four non-Great/Elder Major Aspects. She is a foil to [[Lai]], Aspect of Warmth, and mother to [[Loeleyhn]], Aspect of Snow.

## Description

Loe's passage in [[Theogony Volume II]] reads:

> Glacial Elder Loe, Aspect of Cold
> ***
> Despite what one may think, Loe is not a cold-hearted or cruel Aspect. In fact, she is quite jolly! However, she is known to keep a grudge, with she and Lai having a fierce rivalry, both dropping the friendly faÃ§ade to fiercely debate.

Loe's feud with Lai is a central part of both Aspects' characters, a constant struggle between Warmth and Cold to encompass more of the climate. 

No depiction of Loe's physical form is given in the map.

### Color/Build Scheme

Loe is associated with many colors, including blues, greens, pinks, and purples, mimicking the shades of the aurora. Loe builds very frequently use Divine Ice (Blue Ice), which was created by Loe in this universe.

## History

Loe is one of the Major Aspects, all believed to have been created by the [[Primal Tree]] before the creation of [[Drehmari]] and the start of the First Avihm.

At one point, Lai and Loe were great friends, working together to create various magical tools. The two were worshipped in the region of [[Merijool]], with Lai worshipped in the west and Loe in the east. The two seem to have been on the same side of the [[Divine Schism]], hinting that they were still friends through late Av2, but for unclear reasons, they developed a bitter feud at some point in the years later.

Loe also had a foothold in [[Faehrcyle]], particularly on its forested western coast.

Loe is referred to as the "Avatar of Ash" in the [[Artifacts#Loe'Othrah|Loe'Othrah]] artifact in [[Kamt]], a title seemingly given during the conflicted history of Merijool.

## Devotion Guide

The Crystalline Colonnade in [[Schlonko]] is home to Loe's Devotion site, and grants the "Finders Keepers" advancement when first discovered. Items scattered around the shrine's inner room provide hints as to Loe's low-level preferred offerings, including leather, glow lichen, and glass. The hint book for her higher level devotion offerings reads:

> We have grown impatient as of late. Another new pit of **strange soft snow** has opened up around our Arch-Ducal Castle! Despite throwing all of those things **into the pits** like the Loe Follower said!
>
> Though new pits are showing up less, we wish they would just stop for good!

This refers to the pockets of powdered snow in the area. At the bottom of these pits, players will find item frames that hold the Aspect of Cold's most beloved offerings.

## Late-Game Info

--8<-- "spoiler.md"

--8<-- "LD_spoiler.md"

Like the other Major Aspects, Loe has a significant footprint on [[Lo'Dahr]].

Loe has a secondary shrine and room in [[Ytaj]].

[[Loe's Domain]] is a frozen, mountainous region in the far southwest of the moon, home to the town of [[Loeturia]].

Loe's role in the Divine Schism is elaborated upon slightly in Lo'Dahr, showing that she was an active member of the Anti-Palaesidans and personally appointed [[Kahmas Tuhs]] the leader of their forces in the Second Battle of Ytaj.

[^1]: Loe's gender has been changed during version 2.2's lifespan, and was disputed for some time within the dev team. In initial 2.2 betas, Loe was referred to using she/her pronouns in Theogony, but this was changed to he/him at some later point. When this was brought up to developers, she/her pronouns were settled on, for the sake of consistency with Lai, Lailoehn, and Loeleyhn.
