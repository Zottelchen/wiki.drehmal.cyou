# Taihgel

**Taihgel** (pronounced "tie-gell" OR "tie-jell") is the Aspect of Land, responsible for the creation of the vast majority of the land on Drehmal. They are one of the four Elder Aspects, alongside [[Khive]], [[Rihelma]], and [[Dahr]].

## Description

Taihgel's description in [[Theogony Volume II]] reads:

> Land-Fall Drake Taihgel, Great Land Aspect
> ***
> Taihgel created the land and continents, and is described as a massive earthen turtle. Despite its size, it is known to be a gentle and caring Elder, who often counsels other Aspects for advice.

Taihgel has been dormant for a very long time, with very few worshippers in modern Drehmal. Having been superseded by [[Drehmal]], who effectively re-did its work after the [[Felling]], Taihgel has fallen into the most obscurity of any Elder Aspect.

Taihgel is depicted as a colossal turtle or tortoise.

### Color/Build Scheme

Taihgel is associated with red and orange, and their builds often utilize the colors of terracotta found in Grand Pike Canyon, as well as other ground-related blocks.

## History

Taihgel is one of the four Elder Aspects, the first Aspects made by the [[Primal Tree]] to build the fundamental parts of the world. As Aspect of Land, Taihgel was responsible for the creation of the [[disc]]'s three original continents in the First Avihm.

Taihgel appears to have been widely worshipped in the First Avihm and early Second Avihm, often alongside the other earth-related Aspects [[Koh]] and [[Nahyn]] (its own creations). However, following the [[Felling]] and the destruction of almost all the land Taihgel created, [[Drehmal]] re-formed it, and many of Taihgel's followers likely died. The Land-Fall Drake became dormant, and does not appear to have done much of anything in modern history.

It is suggested from Taihgel's relics that any player who reaches its maximum devotion is their first real follower in an extremely long time, re-awakening the Aspect.

## Devotion Guide

Taihgel's [[devotion]] site is an abandoned cliff dwelling called [[Wokonori]] in northern [[Grand Pike Canyon]].

Taihgel's small underground shrine is littered with low-level offerings, including flint, quartz, and magma blocks. To discover higher-tier offerings, players will need to read the hint book, [[Ancient Earthen Text]], which reads: 

> We, the devout, mine the **taihryte**, sacred to Taihgel, deep under this town, and **bury our desires within its ancient, formless red marbled stone, which burns within and burns without, if ignited, shall burn forever**, may our offerings be incorporated into the virgin stone, the first stone, and may the land walk again.

This points to higher-tier offerings buried in small taihryte (netherrack) deposits throughout Wokonori.

## Late-Game Info

Like all the other Major Aspects, Taihgel has a prominent presence on [[Lo'Dahr]], although their influence is less felt than the other more active Aspects.

![[room_taihgel.png]]

Taihgel's room in [[Ytaj]] is among the most relevant in the entire palace, as it contains a scale map of the world in the First Avihm, as Taihgel and the other Elders initially created it.

![[ytaj_statue_taihgel.png]]

A statue of Taihgel is found in the northeast corner of Ytaj, pictured above. It takes the form of a large tortoise with volcanic cracks in its back, sporting an ankylosaur-like club tail.

[[Taihgel's Domain]] is a relatively large region of Taihryte (netherrack) in the northeast, although it is the smallest of the Elders' domains. This is possibly due to the fact that Taihgel has not been active in a very long time, and its domain has been taken over by the other neighboring Aspects.

It is shown in the [[Closed Diary]] that Taihgel has still attended Prismatic Council meetings in recent years, but they do not appear to have physically visited the palace in many years.
