**Land-Fall Drake Taihgel** is the Aspect of Land, responsible for the creation of the vast majority of the land on Drehmal. They are one of the four Elder Aspects, alongside [[Khive]], [[Rihelma]], and [[Dahr]]. 

Taihgel is a drake, a kind of wingless dragon, but its physical form most closely resembles a colossal tortoise.
