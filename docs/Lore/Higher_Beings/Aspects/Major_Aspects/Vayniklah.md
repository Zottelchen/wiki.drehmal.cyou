# Vayniklah

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Life-Bringer Vayniklah** is the Aspect of Life, and one of the four non-Elder Major Aspects. She is a foil to [[Voynahla]]. Vayniklah is responsible for the creation of life, pulling in souls from across the Veil and placing them in bodies.

As depicted by a statue at her devotion site, Vayniklah appears to have insectoid features, including wings reminiscent of a butterfly.
