# Vayniklah

**Vayniklah** (pronounced "vay-NEEK-law") is the Aspect of Life, and one of the four non-Elder/Great Major Aspects. She is a foil to [[Voynahla]]. Vayniklah is responsible for the creation of some lifeforms, pulling in souls from across the Veil and placing them in bodies.

## Description

Vayniklah's passage in [[Theogony Volume II]] reads:

> Life-Bringer Vayniklah, Aspect of Life
> ***
> Vayniklah’s domain has steadily eroded over time. Originally given the power to create life and heal souls, she could not create complex forms, but is still respected and venerated realmwide.

A statue of Vayniklah at her devotion site in Marahza, pictured above, shows her form. Vayniklah is depicted with insectoid features, primarily wide butterfly wings.

### Color/Build Scheme

Vayniklah is associated with a pallette of green, yellow, and orange. Her builds are often centered around honey and bee-related blocks, as well as plant life such as trees and bushes.

## Role & Powers

Vayniklah acts as the opposite to [[Voynahla]], and her powers are referenced less often. She is reportedly able to "create life and heal souls", and is known as a healer to the other gods.

## History

Vayniklah is one of the Major Aspects, all believed to have been created by the [[Primal Tree]] before the creation of [[Drehmari]] and the start of the First Avihm.

Early in the realm's history, likely before the dawn of Drehmari civilization, Vayniklah created the Aspects of Drehmari ([[Mari]]) and Beasts ([[Muhs]]), effectively her children, to help her make the more complex lifeforms of the realm. She is also one parent/creator of [[Noha]], Aspect of Harvest, alongside [[Taihgel]].

It is unclear where, if at all, Vayniklah had significant pockets of worshippers or a clear sphere of influence. It is possible that her worship in Av1 was similar to that of [[Virtuo]] in Av2 and Av3, a widely beloved Aspect venerated by many. 

From the [[Artifacts#Talisman of Endless Growth|Talisman of Endless Growth]], it is clear that Vayniklah's followers had some hand in the creation of the [[Primal Sapling]], attempting to rejuvenate the soul of the realm. It is unclear if the Life-Bringer herself was involved in this mysterious process.

## Devotion Guide

Vayniklah's [[devotion]] site is a shrine in the Temple of the Bloom and Bough, at the [[Akhlo'Rohma|Akhlo'Rohman]] village of [[Marahza]].

Around Vayniklah's shrine are item frames with her low-level devotion offerings: cactus blocks, eggs, and sunflowers. The nearby hint book reads:

> To worship Vayniklah is to improve life for the living. Just as plants are happier with fertilizer, Drehmari are happier with mead! To that end, I told my friends to find the best possible **recipe**. Now, it’s time to go across Akhlo'Rohma and **visit their stills**. I am sure that their ingredients will please Her!

Throughout Akhlo'Rohma, stills of mead such as the one found just outside this building (made of basalt and slate) can be found, and a high-level offering is hidden inside each of them.

??? info "Hint Locations"
    There are 6 of these kegs in the region, found at the following locations: a [[Maelmari]]-occupied house in the southwest, the basement of [[Ancehl Castle]], [[Dusps]] near the Northern Kitchen restaurant, [[Marahza]] very close to the Temple of Bloom and Bough, on an isolated plateau in the northeast, and [[Akhlo'Rohma#Esipelli Vineyard|Esipelli Vineyard]].

## Late-Game Info

--8<-- "spoiler.md"

--8<-- "LD_spoiler.md"

Like the other Major Aspects, Vayniklah has a significant footprint on [[Lo'Dahr]].

Vayniklah's area in [[Ytaj]] is an outdoor shrine in the northwest, with a very large flowering tree.

[[Vayniklah's Domain]] is a large jungle in the northwest, where her [[Tehrmari]] followers reside. The major attraction here is her trial at the [[Temple of Life]], which rewards the player with the [[Eldermead]] legendary item.

The community-restored [[Codex Celestus]] also mentions Vayniklah, stating that she and [[Voynahla]] together concern themselves with the transport of souls from beyond the Veil to their mortal vessels, then back out. This makes Vayniklah one of the few Aspects confirmed to have some knowledge of what lies beyond the Veil.
