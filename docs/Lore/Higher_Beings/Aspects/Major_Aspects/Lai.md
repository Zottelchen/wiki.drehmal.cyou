## Description

Lai's passage in [[Theogony Volume II]] reads:

> Brightwyrm Lai, Aspect of Warmth
> ***
> Lai brought the joy of warmth into our lives, and reflects that warmth in his sunny disposition. Lai is by far the most cheerful and accommodating Aspect, and is known for his easy-going nature even amongst mortals.

Lai's feud with Loe is a central part of both Aspects' characters, a constant struggle between Warmth and Cold to encompass more of the climate. 

Lai's physical form is that of a fiery axolotl.

### Color/Build Scheme

Lai is associated with the many colors of his sacred chromatic flame, but in particular, his builds often utilize red, orange, yellow, blues, and purple, as well as a Taihryte/Taihryte brick base. These builds often depict a chromatic flame itself.

## History

Lai is one of the Major Aspects, all believed to have been created by the [[Primal Tree]] before the creation of [[Drehmari]] and the start of the First Avihm.

At one point, Lai and Loe were great friends, working together to create various magical tools. The two were worshipped in the region of [[Merijool]], with Lai worshipped in the west and Loe in the east. The two seem to have been on the same side of the [[Divine Schism]], hinting that they were still friends through late Av2, but for unclear reasons, they developed a bitter feud at some point in the years later.

Lai also had a foothold in [[Faehrcyle]], particularly around the volcanic Totoron Lakes region.

## Devotion Guide

Lai's [[devotion]] site is the [[Shrine of Eternal Flame]] in northwestern [[Merijool]].

Lai's devotion altar is located in the center of the pyramid, along with the devotion hint book [[Getting Warmer|Getting Warmer?]]. Low-level offerings are strewn about the area, including gunpowder, campfires, and lanterns. The hint book leads to higher-level offerings, and reads:

> Kind Traveler,
>
> Though this sacred flame once burned longer and brighter than any other, it has sadly been extinguished.
>
> But there are still **many other sacred flames burning in Merijool**. If you find one, leave an offering to Lai **beneath**.
>
> Our faith is what stops this land from freezing!
>
> Signed, Pilgrim of the South

Better offerings can be discovered underneath the multicolored flames present throughout western Merijool.

Like the other Major Aspects, Lai has a significant footprint on [[Lo'Dahr]].

![[room_lai.png]]

Lai has a secondary shrine and room in [[Ytaj]], which features a massive chromatic, sacred flame of various stained glass colors.

[[Lai's Domain]] is a massive volcano in the far northeast of the moon, home to the [[Brightwyrm's Caldarium]], the site of his trial.

In [[Naharja]], a Pet Store sells an easter egg item: a glowing, invulnerable axolotl simply named "Lai", intended to represent the Aspect himself.
