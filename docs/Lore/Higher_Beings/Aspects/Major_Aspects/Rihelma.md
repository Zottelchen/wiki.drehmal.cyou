--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Star-Rise Drake Rihelma** is the Aspect of Sky, and one of the four Elder Aspects alongside [[Khive]], [[Dahr]], and [[Taihgel]]. In addition to her dominion over the skies, Rihelma has uniquely potent powers of foresight, being able to commune with outside forces and create prophecies out of the futures that she sees.

Rihelma takes the physical form of a large drake, a type of flying dragon.
