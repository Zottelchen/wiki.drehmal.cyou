# Voynahla

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Soul-Stealer Voynahla** is the Aspect of Death, and one of four non-Elder/Great Major Aspects. He is a foil to [[Vayniklah]]. His primary duty is to ferry souls across the Veil after their death, back to their place of origin, but he also has general dominion over the concept of death itself.

During the [[Divine Schism]], Voynahla attempted to take his own life, but due to his power over death, remains partially alive to this day.
