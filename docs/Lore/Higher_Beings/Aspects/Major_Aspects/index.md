# Major Aspects

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

Out of the 23 Aspects, 8 are considered to be Major Aspects, boasting dominion over extremely broad areas of reality and wielding significantly more power than the [Minor Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/Minor_Aspects/). The Major Aspects are also the oldest of the Aspects, having been created by the [[Primal Tree]] in Av1.

The four **Elder Aspects**—[[Khive]], [[Rihelma]], [[Dahr]], and [[Taihgel]]—are the oldest, wisest, and most powerful of the Aspects. They are Major Aspects, but are especially revered. They are sometimes also called **Great Aspects**.

The other four Major Aspects—[[Lai]], [[Loe]], [[Vayniklah]], and [[Voynahla]]—are also incredibly powerful, but are not among the Elder Aspects.
