# Higher Beings

Powerful beings that govern the realm are responsible for many natural phenomena. Despite their inherent power, all higher beings appear to be mortal.

## [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/)

> Family tree of the Aspects and Deities of Drehmal. Each block represents an Aspect, besides the three at the very top, which represent the three deities ([[Maelihs]], [[Drehmal]], [[Virtuo]], left to right).

Most higher beings in the realm of Drehmal fall under the category of Aspects. Aspects are draconic deities who govern their own domains of nature, and some create children who inherit subcategories of their parent or parents' jurisdiction. Aspects can be divided into two groups: Major and Minor Aspects.

### [Major Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/Major_Aspects/)

Major Aspects are considered to be the most important Aspects and those with the broadest domains, and they were directly created by the [[Primal Tree]]. A subcategory of the Major Aspects are the Elder Aspects ([[Khive]], [[Dahr]], [[Rihelma]], and [[Taihgel]]), who are deemed to be the most powerful. All eight Major Aspects have [[Devotion|devotion]] sites in-game, in addition to the three [Deities](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Deities/).

### [Minor Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/Minor_Aspects/)

Minor Aspects are younger and less powerful Aspects, and are the children of Major Aspects. The exception to this is [[Lahrs]], who was created by the Primal Tree and is the subject of debate for classification ([[Verrhys]] was also created by the Primal Tree, but their existence isn't known to people in the present day.)

## The Three Deities

Upon the felling of the Primal Tree, marking the beginning of the Second Avihm, three deities were born from it; [[Maelihs]], [[Virtuo]] and [[Drehmal]]. These deities are notably more powerful than most, if not all, of the Aspects, and play a much more significant role in the history of Drehmal and the affairs of the [[Drehmari]]. Maelihs and Virtuo both take the form of very large people, and historically they and their devotees have clashed with each other. Drehmal is a colossal serpent and the most powerful of the three deities, and is responsible for reshaping the land (which is now named after them) after the destruction of the old one from the First Avihm. At the time that the map's story begins, Maelihs's empire on Drehmal still thrives in the West, whereas Virtuo has left the continent but retains a significant following in the East. Drehmal has been slumbering deep underground beneath the Primal Caverns since the early Second Avihm, when they finished their task of reforming the world.

## The Primal Tree

The origins of the [[Primal Tree]] are unclear, but it was most likely the first living thing to exist in the realm of Drehmal, and it created the first Aspects and [[Drehmari]]. The Primal Tree was a tree of gargantuan proportions, much taller than mountains, and it sat at the center of what is now the continent of Drehmal in the First Avihm. In the Battle of Karesh at the base of the Tree, fought between the [[Viruhn]] and [[Maelruhn]], the Tree was burnt and uprooted, severely damaging the land and rendering it uninhabitable. The Primal Tree granted the last of its power to three figures, who became Maelihs, Virtuo and Drehmal. This event marked the beginning of the Second Avihm. The only remnant left of the Primal Tree today is the [[Primal Sapling]], which is a smaller (but still giant) and malicious version of the Tree that stands in southeast [[Merijool]].

## Other Higher Beings

There are presumed to be [[yellow|other higher beings]] above the realm of Drehmal's plane of existence, but very little is known about them.


[^1]: Aspects' gender is extrapolated from the pronouns used to refer to them in-game, which are canon. M = Masculine, F = Feminine, N = Neither/Nonbinary
[^2]: References to Dahroehl typically alternate between both use of masculine and feminine pronouns, implying that the Aspect is genderfluid.
