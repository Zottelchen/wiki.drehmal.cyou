# Higher Beings

According to the lore, powerful beings that govern the realm are responsible for many natural phenomena. Despite their inherent power, all higher beings are mortal.

## Aspects

Most higher beings in the realm of Drehmal fall under the category of Aspects. Aspects are reptilian deities who govern their own domains of nature, and some create children who inherit subcategories of their parent(s)’s jurisdiction. Aspects can be divided into two groups: Major and Minor Aspects.

### Major Aspects

Major Aspects are considered to be the most important Aspects and those with the broadest domains. All Major Aspects were created by the Primal Tree. A subcategory of the Major Aspects are the Elder Aspects (Khive, Dahr, Rihelma, Taihgel), who are deemed to be the most powerful. Major Aspects have devotion sites in-game.

### Minor Aspects

Minor Aspects are younger and less powerful Aspects, and are the children of Major Aspects. The exception to this is Lahrs, who was created by the Primal Tree and is the subject of debate for classification (Verrhys was also created by the Primal Tree, but their existence isn't known to people in the present day.)

## The Three Deities

Upon the felling of the Primal Tree, marking the beginning of the Second Avihm, three deities were born from it; [[Maelihs]], [[Virtuo]] and [[Drehmal]]. Maelihs and Virtuo both take the form of large people, and historically they and their devotees have clashed with each other. Drehmal is a colossal serpent and the most powerful of the three deities, and is responsible for reshaping the land (which is now named after them) after the destruction of the old one from the First Avihm. Currently, Maelihs resides in [[Ytaj]] on [[Lo’Dahr]], and his empire on Drehmal still thrives in the West. Virtuo is in Xivrhynt with her Grand Parish on a mission to thoroughly spread her purity across Drehmal. Drehmal has been slumbering deep underground beneath the Primal Caverns since the early Second Avihm, when they finished their task of recreation.

## The Primal Tree

The origins of the [[Primal Tree]] are unclear, but it was most likely the first living thing to exist in the realm of Drehmal, and it created the first Aspects and Drehmari. The Primal Tree was a tree of gargantuan proportions, much taller than mountains, and it sat at the center of what is now [[Drehmal (Place)|Drehmal]] in the First Avihm. In the Battle of Karesh at the base of the Tree, fought between the Viruhn and Maelruhn, the Tree was burnt and uprooted, severely damaging the land and rendering it uninhabitable. The Primal Tree granted the last of its power to three figures, who became Maelihs, Virtuo and Drehmal. This event marked the beginning of the Second Avihm. The only remnant left of the Primal Tree today is the [[Primal Sapling]], which is a smaller (but still giant) and malicious version of the Tree that stands in southeast [[Merijool]].

## The Mythoclast

[[Mythoclast|The Mythoclast]] is the most powerful entity in the universe. They preside over the [[Court of Nothing]], a chamber in the Heart of the Void where all souls pass through to be judged on their way to rebirth. The Mythoclast's true form is unable to be perceived by regular people, but they can take the form of a golden serpentine dragon. The Mythoclast orchestrated the eradication of the [[Empire of Avsohm]] after [[Uffhiel Anyr|Emperor Anyr]] proved to be a threat to their position of power, and the [Castle Hovadchear Crater|disappearence of Castle Hovadchear] when the [[Order of Insohm]] started to recreate Avsohmic technology and uncover their secrets.
