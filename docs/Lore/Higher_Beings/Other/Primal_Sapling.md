The **Primal Sapling** is a colossal tree in the [[Glade of the Giant]] in southeastern [[Merijool]]. Vaguely recognized as a successor to and/or remnant of the original [[Primal Tree]], the Primal Sapling is also suggested to be malignant in some way, heavily associated with cancer.

## Build

The Sapling sits in a mountain bowl with jungle terrain, implied to be that of Merijool from before the [[Frostfang Catastrophe]]. It towers over the surrounding landscape, reaching all the way up to y=256 with leaves forming a circle with a diameter of about 300 blocks at the top. The tree is made out of a blend of spruce and dark oak wood.

## In-Map References

There are three items with lore text relating to this tree. The first, a book simply titled [[The Primal Sapling]], is found in nearby [[Okeke]], its title being the only source of the tree's name. It reads:

> Do you see it, in the distance? The leafy branches of a great tree? The fog may obscure your vision, but it does not obscure mine. I see beyond the mountains to the east a primal remnant of what came before. Alas, its malignant will lies in opposition to its predecessor. A cancerous growth upon the realm, indeed, despite the inherent futility. No one can escape the coming storm.

A pyramid nearby holds the [[Artifacts#Talisman of Endless Growth|Talisman of Endless Growth]], whose lore text reads:

> Chipped murals on ancient walls tell the story of the Great Revel. While Vayniklah's faithful hoped to revive the soul of the world, instead they opened the door to something far more sinister.

The final item is [[Parenchyma]], a legendary chestplate located inside the base of the tree itself. Its lore text reads:

> A gift from an ancient traveler crafted by the hands of nature. It is made of roots that resemble Drehmal's flora but contains remnants of places beyond.

## Possible Lore Implications

The Primal Sapling is a very mysterious force in Drehmal's lore, seemingly a remnant of the [[Primal Tree]] itself. The supposed murals referenced by the Talisman do not appear to exist in-map, meaning that we can only guess what the "Great Revel" truly was. It is implied that this was a ritual meant to revive the fallen Primal Tree, but it is not clear how this was done, or when. The matter of what this "far more sinister" thing the Talisman refers to is also unknown.

Many of these words that are used to refer to the Sapling are heavily linked to cancer: the tree is explicitly called a "cancerous growth upon the realm", "parenchyma" can refer to tumor tissue, and its "will" is called "malignant". Likewise, cancer is a disease of "endless growth". Together, this may suggest that the Sapling is growing out of control.
