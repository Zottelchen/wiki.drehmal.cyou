# The Primal Tree

The **Primal Tree** was an extremely powerful organism at the very beginning of the history of Drehmal. It is stated that reality itself formed around the Primal Tree, and that many of the gods of Drehmal—the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) and [Deities](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Deities/)—were created by the Tree. The Tree is also stated to be responsible for the creation of [[Drehmari]].

The Primal Tree only existed during the First Avihm, during which time it created the first Aspects, who in turn were given dominion over certain aspects of reality.

Very little is known about the Tree itself, although it appears to have been sentient to some degree and extremely powerful. During a battle at the end of Av1 (possibly the "Battle of Karesh", although this association is not explicitly drawn in-map), the Tree was destroyed at its roots, in an event known as [[Felling|The Felling]]. The Felling of the Tree physically destroyed most of the land of the [[disc]], including all three original continents in the First Avihm.

As the Tree died, it imparted the last of its energy into the three Deities: [[Maelihs]], [[Virtuo]], and [[Drehmal]], ascending them all to godhood with power greater than any of the individual Aspects. The Felling marked the end of the First Avihm.

The [[Primal Sapling]], which still exists in modern-day [[Merijool]], is said to be the successor to the Tree. This tree's true nature and origins are very unclear.

## Aspects

The [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) are believed to have come from flowers of the Primal Tree, created in order to assist the Tree in making the world. In particular, the Major Aspects were all directly created by the Tree, while the Minor Aspects seem to have been created by Major Aspects. 

## Location

The Tree was likely located in the middle of the central Av1 continent of [[Lore Locations#Primzahl|Primzahl]]. This location does not exist in modern Drehmal, but signs point toward the [[Primal Caverns]] being the site where the tree once stood.

## Felling

!!! info "Main Article: [[Felling]]"

The Felling was a cataclysmic event that ended the First Avihm, in which the Primal Tree toppled over. It seems to be the case that this event was brought about by a battle between the ancient [[Maelruhn]] and [[Viruhn]] peoples.
