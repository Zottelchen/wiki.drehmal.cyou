Maelihs is one of the three deities born from the Primal Tree upon its collapse, and is identified as a god representing chaos and destruction. He has been a major figure in the history of [Drehmal[Drehmal (Place)]] since the beginning of the Second Avihm.

## Characteristics

Maelihs takes the form of a __-foot tall armored person with tall, red and white pointed horns. He is known for being wrathful and aggressive, comstantly being in a struggle to conquer to realm. In recent years, however, he has grown into a more peaceful state out of regret for his actions.

## [[Maelmari]]

The Maelmari are Maelihs's ascended version of Drehmari. Maelmari have pale, red skin, yellow eyes, and gray horns similar in shape to those of Maelihs but much smaller. Many Maelmari are used as soldiers and guards for the Maelihs's empire, and the more educated ones live in the city of [[Rhaveloth]] at the gateway to the [[Crimson Gorge]].

## History

In the First Avihm, before his divine rebirth, Maelihs was a man named Naurduul, who was a member of the Maelruhn people of west [[Xivhrynt]]. The details of this time are unclear, but it is known that he received divine power from the Primal Tree upon its destruction, and the initial experience was agonizing (his whole body was probably severely burnt). 

In the early days of the Second Avihm, Maelihs established [his own empire[Empire of Maelihs]] in southwestern Drehmal, centered around the [[Burnt Palace]] in the [[Hellcrags]]. He ascended his Drehmari worshipers and prisoners to Maelmari, who were used to fuel his war effort against [[Virtuo]] in the [[Deity War]]. The First Tharhan Empire supported Maelihs with weapons and people in order to dissuade an attack.
