# The Deities

In Drehmal, there are three higher beings whose status is above those of the Aspects, and they are known as Deities. These three figures—[[Drehmal]], [[Maelihs]], and [[Virtuo]]—were all born from some fragment of the [[Primal Tree]] upon its felling at the end of Av1, inheriting greater portions of the Tree's spirit and power than the Aspects had. As such, they take different appearances than the Aspects, and have greater levels of power, although they are younger than the Aspects.

## Drehmal
[[Drehmal]] is the colossal serpentine creator deity of the realm, responsible for reshaping the land after the cataclysm that occurred at the end of Av1, making it inhabitable again. They are widely worshipped throughout the continent, although they have not been physically present in the realm for millennia by the time that the player emerges from stasis.

## Maelihs
[[Maelihs]] is the god of chaos, frequently portrayed as an antagonistic figure to the [[Drehmari]], the dominant humanoid race on Drehmal. His empire reigns over a significant portion of the western third of the continent, but he himself is nowhere to be found on Drehmal.

## Virtuo
[[Virtuo]] is the goddess of Peace, Purity, and Perfection. For most of her life, she was the most widely worshipped deity among the Drehmari, frequently preaching to them and waging protective wars against Mael, but she abandoned the continent approximately a century before the player emerges from stasis, leaving a confused and spiteful populace in the East, her traditional sphere of influence.
