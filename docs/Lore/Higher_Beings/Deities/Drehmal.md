Drehmal is the most powerful of the three deities born from the Primal Tree upon its collapse at the end of the First Avihm. With most of the land being destroyed, Drehmal took it upon themselves to shape a new world from the ruined remains of the old one. The new land, which is the one present in-game, is named "Drehmal", after the deity.

## Characteristics

Drehmal takes the form of a gargantuan, pale green serpent with antlers, a beard and sharp teeth. They are known for their incredibly wise snd peaceful demeanor. Drehmal is referred to exclusively with gender-neutral "they," "them," and "their" pronouns.

## History 

In the First Avihm, before being granted their current deific identity, Drehmal was merely a simple worm of some sorts. As recounted by [[The Parable of the Worm]], they were approached by two figures, a "beast of the sky" and a "beast of the depths". Both criticized the worm for not acting on their potential, yet they resolved to wait for the right time.
During the Battle of Karesh, the worm nestled between the roots of the Primal Tree, and the Tree gifted a portion of its remaining essence to the worm, ascending them to the divine serpent Drehmal.

Drehmal spent the early days of the Second Avihm molding landforms and fostering new life. During this time, Drehmal often interacted with Drehmari, especially the ancient Drehua people of Palisahd (modern day [[Palisades Heath]]). Four such interactions, as recorded by Drehua monks who became heralded as prophets, are recorded in the four Parables at Drehua Temple. After Drehmal's work was completed, they buried themselves far beneath the Primal Caverns and fell into a deep, dream-filled slumber. Drehmal continued to be worshipped throughout Palisades Heath, the Central Plains and the Heartwood. Worship of Drehmal became most widespread under the rule of Avsohm, which originated in the Central Plains and spread its religion around the continent. Worship of the Aspects was banned in the empire under the reign of Zorhis Ifeihl, and Maelihs was an enemy of the state, meaning citizens paid homage to either Virtuo or Drehmal. Today, Drehmal is still worshiped in their traditional sphere of influence from before the rise and expansion of Avsohm.

## In-Game Interactions
While Drehmal remains in their deep slumber for the entirety of the player's experience in the current day, there is one point at which the serpent can be somewhat directly interacted with, at the Tower of Drehmal in [[Ytaj]]. Here, the player climbs a tower while seemingly living through the dreams and thoughts of Drehmal themselves, while gradually ascending the tower to reach a second devotion shrine to Drehmal at its peak. 

A transcript of the climb's dialogue can be found [[Dreams_of_the_Serpent.md|here]].

Drehmal is also prominently featured in the [[True End|final sequence of the game]], with their ultimate fate told to the player by [[yellow|???]].
