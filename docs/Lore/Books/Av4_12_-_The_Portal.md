### Location/Summary:
This book can be found in a chest atop the [[Burnt Palace]]. It is the final piece of writing from [[Maelihs]] in the burnt palace, written the day before he left for [[Lo'Dahr]] indefinitely.

### Transcription:
> I leave tomorrow. Everything is in order; or what counts as order amongst the whelps that I command.
>
> I have instructed Tevus to close the portal behind me. One would need to toss an amethyst shard into the frame in order to reconnect with the Divine Moon. That should be enough of a deterrent to stop anyone from finding me at Ytaj.
