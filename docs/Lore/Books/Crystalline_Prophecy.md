### Location/Summary:
This book can be found on a lectern in the [[Star-Rise Bastion]] on the [[Island of Dawn]]. It contains a prophecy given by [[Rihelma]] to her followers at the bastion, in which crystals erupted from the ground around the island, containing common items that the Star-Rise Drake requires. These hint at items which can be given to Rihelma's shrine in the bastion to increase her devotion level.

### Transcription:
> Shortly after the Abandonment and our Celestial Rebirth, the Goddess of the Endless Sky spoke to us via the Scrying Stones. Clad in spirals of rippling starlight, the Stones erupted from the very soil of our island, and within was Truth.
>
> They spoke of times now and afar, and, strangely, contained commonplace items deep within their starry cores. At first it was unclear what this meant. But as we knelt beside the one that erupted in the center of the basement mushroom farm, Abbess Mahan suddenly fell into a trance. When she awakened, the wisdom of the Star-Rise Drake tumbled from her lips. “Children, the continuum calls, and these items are required. If you have faith, find them, and the pattern will unfold”.
>
> Since hearing these truths and others from the Scrying Stones, we have taken up this task with piety and assertiveness. It is part of our penance to acquire the items by any means if we must. We will rinse our hands of the Deceitful Mistress and grow wings to soar.
