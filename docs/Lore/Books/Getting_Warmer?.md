This book can be found on a lectern at the [[Shrine of Eternal Flame]] in [[Merijool]]. It asks the reader to make an offering to [[Lai]] at any of the sacred flames around the region.

### Transcription:
> Kind Traveler,
>
> Though this sacred flame once burned longer and brighter than any other, it has sadly been extinguished. However, there still are many others throughout Merijool. If you find them, leave an offering to show your devotion to the Aspect of Warmth. It is through our faith that they continue to burn and keep this land from freezing over like Faehrcyle far to the Northeast. May the flames reveal their truths to your weary eyes!
