This book can be found on a lectern in a ruined building just west of [[Sal'Lorahn]]. It references the four cardinal directions, each representing something relative to Sal'Lorahn. To the north of this ruined city lied the majority of the other governments of Drehmal, predominantly Tharhan kingdoms and Avsohm. The moon of [[Lo'Dahr]] lies in the southern sky. The "hidden sanctuary" to the east references the [[Moonlight Sanctum]]. "Canyons marked by dancing flame" to the west likely reference the [[Crimson Gorge]] or other parts of [[The Carmine]], possibly the [[Birthing Grounds]].

## Transcription
> To be an alchemist of Salâ€™Lorahn, one must know four directions:
>
> To the North lie the heretical kingdoms, short-sighted and hateful.
>
> To the South lies the Divine Moon, luminous over the endless sea.
>
> To the East lies the hidden sanctuary for which we are grateful.
>
> To the West, through canyons marked by dancing flame, is where we came to be.
