### Location/Summary:
This book can be found on a lectern in the ruined university at [[Av'Sal]]. It provides, as the title suggests, a brief introduction to alchemy, primarily the main goal of all alchemistsâ€”to complete the Great Work.

### Transcription:
> Most contemporary Alchemists view our field through the lens of one of three schools. Although these schools developed somewhat independently, and at times went by different names, modern Alchemy is considered a syncretic study of all three. Experienced Alchemists generally specialize in a particular school after five years of study, and master Alchemists will often be highly specialized in a single school. However, the true savants among us may seamlessly combine all schools. While there are many differences between the schools, all share the same goal: the completion of the Great Work.
