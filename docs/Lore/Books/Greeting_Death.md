### Location/Summary:
This book can be found on a lectern at the [[Perishing Well]]. It instructs followers of [[Voynahla]] to prepare themselves properly for their own deaths, so as to gain favor with their patron Aspect and attain favorable reincarnation.

### Transcription:
> Let this message serve as a warning.
>
> Though you lived a life of great devotion and brought a final peace to many hundreds or thousands of lives, you must not neglect preparations for your own death, or you risk dishonoring the Aspect of Death.
>
> If you have any power in your limbs, wield the knife. Jump from the cliff. Take the vial of Night’s Whisper and swallow hard.
>
> But if death comes suddenly, make arrangements to be buried beneath death's head with items you carry to appease Voynahla’s spirit. Seek the services of local undertakers in places with cemeteries, but do not be buried within the towns of the living themselves.
>
> Show no fear, and you may be granted favorable reincarnation. This is the way that things must be.
