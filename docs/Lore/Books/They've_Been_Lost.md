# They've Been Lost

They've Been Lost can be found in a chest in [[Mt. Yavhlix]]. It describes the corruption of one of the workers at the [[Primary Collection Facility]], Theru, being corrupted by forces beyond her control.

> Theru's been taken. I don't know by what, but her mind is no longer present. It's clear that she has some purpose, but... not her own. Her eyes glow a faint yellow now. She tried to kill me, so they threw her down the pit. She managed to crawl back up, half alive, legs broken, and to the portal.
>
> Then she just stood there.
>
> She only attacked when people got close to the portal.
>
> Something has corrupted this place.
