# The Facets (ENDGAME SPOILER BOOKS)

The Facets are a collection of seven (7) signed, written books found in [[Lo'Dahr]] through the [[Syzygy]] questline. The first six facets are all awarded after completing one of the six trials on the moon, and the seventh is awarded at the final location the player is guided towards after completing all of the trials. 

The facets are written as verses of scripture, containing prophecies foreseen by [[Rihelma]].

The exact meaning behind these books is not 100% confirmed, but it has been speculated by the community that each individual Facet describes what would happen if one of the characters in the Drehmal universe were to complete [[The Ambition]], effectively dethroning The [[Mythoclast]] and becoming the ultimate ruler of the multiverse. The text then portrays what would ultimately happen to the realm of Drehmal in this scenario.
