# The Facets 

The Facets are a collection of seven (7) signed, written books found in [[Lo'Dahr]] through the [[Syzygy]] questline. The first six facets are all awarded after completing one of the six trials on the moon, and the seventh is awarded at the final location the player is guided towards after completing all of the trials. 

The facets are written as verses of scripture, containing prophecies foreseen by [[Rihelma]].

The exact meaning behind these books is not 100% confirmed, but the widely accepted interpretation within the community is that each individual Facet describes what would happen if one of the characters in the Drehmal universe were to complete [[The Ambition]], effectively dethroning The [[Mythoclast]] and becoming the ultimate ruler of all existence. 

Under this interpretation, each respective text portrays what would ultimately happen to the realm of Drehmal under their new ruler.

## Facet I ([[Khive]]'s Trial)

### Coordinates (After Trial):
| **X** | **Y**| **Z** |
|:-----:|:----:|:-----:|
|-761  |98   |-788  |

### Location/Summary:
This book can be found in a chest at the [[Mystic Gallery]], upon completion of the trial at that location. 

It is believed to be a description of a hypothetical world in which [[Aok]], the First Necromancer, completes the Ambition. In this timeline, Aok gains supreme power over the [[Aspects]], with particular focus on his killing of Khive, the Aspect of Magic whom Aok is implied to have betrayed. Aok calls upon an army of the dead to wage his war against the Aspects, and ultimately wins, causing all to collapse into one.

### Transcription:
> 1:1 - His maw is wide, his teeth are many. Of the wicked, he is the most profaned.
>
> 1:2 - And the Mystic Elder shall lie at his feet, viscous ichor dripping from their neck. All will fear him.
>
> 1:3 - In the final days he shall gather each first-born child and their cries will echo the world. No more children shall be born breathing.
>
> 1:4 - He will walk the graves, bringing forth marionettes to fuel his ambition. All color will be drained where he steps.
>
> 1:5 - On the final day he will tap the Tree, and drink its sap. It will blacken and rot, and the Aspects will grow utterly powerless.
>
> 1:6 - And all shall collapse into one.

## Facet III ([[Nahyn]]'s Trial)

### Coordinates (After Trial):
| **X** | **Y**| **Z** |
|:-----:|:----:|:-----:|
|530  |123   |15  |

### Location/Summary:
This book can be found in a chest in the [[Hypogean Labyrinth]], upon completion of the trial at that location. 

Due to the repeated references to silence in this facet, it has been posited that this is the timeline in which the nearly unmentioned [[Verrhys]], Aspect of Silence, completes the Ambition and brings the realm to a state of total silence and peace.

However, much more prominently, this facet is a near-direct reflection of the actual fate of Drehmal in the main storyline. In particular, the awakening of [[Drehmal]], as foretold in 3:3, the formation of vast sand dunes across the world as foretold in 3:4, and the final being standing alone to observe the end, then being offered closure, as shown in 3:5, is a perfect match for the final sequence of the map. This has sparked conversation about the potential ties between [[Verrhys]] and the [[Mythoclast]], but at this point, there are no concrete ties between these two entities, with sparingly few details existing at all in regards to the former.

### Transcription:
> 3:1 - Silence will creep into every corner of the realm. It will be a quiet and peaceful passing.
>
> 3:2 - We will drift to the apex, moons will shatter and sable crystals shall grow up from the very roots.
>
> 3:3 - The last day is near, and they will finally awaken for its passing. They will rot, leaving behind miles of bone. They will be at peace.
>
> 3:4 - The sky shall weep as the realm is consumed. Pale sands shall sweep through everything, forming vast dunes across the disc.
>
> 3:5 - One being shall stand alone to observe the end. They will be offered closure.
>
> 3:6 - And silence will spread its wings.

## Facet IV ([[Dahr]]'s Trial)

### Coordinates (After Trial):
| **X** | **Y**| **Z** |
|:-----:|:----:|:-----:|
|198  |18   |1177  |

### Location/Summary:
This book can be found in a chest in [[Abyssal Rise]], upon completion of the trial at that location. 

It is believed to be a description of a hypothetical world in which [[Maelihs]] completes the Ambition, conquering the realm and bathing it in fire before he, too, is consumed by sorrow and flame, and nothing but ash remains.

### Transcription:
> 4:1 - He shall ride at the helm of a maelstrom host as the warhorn sounds in the plains. Outriders will clash with weakened militias, and their corpses will be consumed.
>
> 4:2 - Nations will be flooded with liquid fire, and flesh will char into slurry. It will fuel his forges.
>
> 4:3 - The carrion birds shall be crushed into the exposed ribs of the fallen.
>
> 4:4 -  The survivors kneel as the firestorm builds, a congregation to conflagration.
>
> 4:5 -  His vengeful face shall melt into sorrow, as he tries to hold his eyes in place.
>
> 4:6 -  Only ash shall color the worldâ€™s rocky bones.

## Facet V ([[Lai]]'s Trial)

### Coordinates (After Trial):
| **X** | **Y**| **Z** |
|:-----:|:----:|:-----:|
|1108  |70   |-1198  |

### Location/Summary:
This book can be found in a chest in the [[Brightwyrm's Calderium]], upon completion of the trial at that location. 

Its text appears to represent the timeline in which [[Virtuo]] achieves the Ambition, and molds the realm into her idea of true perfection, entirely symmetrical and in perfect order. In this scenario, she assumes complete control over the Aspects and rules as the strongest part of a perfect triumvirate, until eventually the "dark wind" blows and brings decay to this beautiful world. This may be a reference to Those Beyond or [[The Nothing]] at large, furthering the ties between Virtuo, [[Eastern Xivrhynt]], and the Nothing.

### Transcription:
> 5:1 - She will walk the copse, and the ancient trees shall stand at attention.
>
> 5:2 - Humming in resonance, the Aspects themselves shall kneel before her.
>
> 5:3 - A triumvirate of perfect order shall weave flesh into shining steel.
>
> 5:4 - The continents will smooth into perfect symmetry. Mountain will face mountain, and tree will match tree.
>
> 5:5 - Hardening and coalescing, the realm shall meld into one shimmering whole. Her elation will be overwhelming.
>
> 5:6 - The dark wind will blow, leaving beauty to decay.

## Facet VI ([[Vayniklah]]'s Trial)

### Coordinates (After Trial):
| **X** | **Y**| **Z** |
|:-----:|:----:|:-----:|
|-485  |74   |-222  |

### Location/Summary:
This book can be found in a chest at the [[Temple of Life]], upon completion of the trial at that location. 

It is believed that this book represents a reality in which [[Lahrs]], Aspect of Resonance, completes the Ambition. Lahrs, a very mysterious Aspect that is seldom mentioned but seems to be integral to the fundamental concept of balance within the world of Drehmal, has one of the more positive spins on the realm's end. In this timeline, a cyclical form of balance is thoroughly restored to the realm, with eternal life being granted to all and with all conflict seemingly ending due to the total elimination of "the malevolent."

### Transcription:
> 6:1 - From the soil shall sprout new life, and Meadows will walk once more.
>
> 6:2 - Souls will cease being stolen, existence eternal granted to all. In eternality, the skies shall be one.
>
> 6:3 - We will dance together, circling cycles as wondrous music serenades our souls.
>
> 6:4 - Brother will forgive brother and sister shall embrace sister. Parents shall rejoice with their children, as all born for the rest of time will know only peace and bliss.
>
> 6:5 - The malevolent will never walk the soil again.
>
> 6:6 - And resonance shall swallow silence.
