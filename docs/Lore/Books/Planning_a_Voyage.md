### Transcription:
> I'm almost ready to set sail towards the Island of Dusk. Over 1000 meters north... quite the treacherous journey. Wonder what I'll find there? If I understand correctly, the only people who dare traverse the northern sea to the islands are miners and researchers, not tourists. Count me as one of the lucky few.
