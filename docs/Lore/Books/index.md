# Written Books

## Introduction
Over 380 lore books can be found scattered throughout the realm of Drehmal, and every one of them is represented in this section of the wiki. Custom-written by the dev team and placed in unique locations corresponding to their contents, these books are one of—if not the most—significant ways that you as a player can learn about the rich, fantastically interwoven story and history of Drehmal.

Books may be found in main story structures, although they typically provide more of a supplement to the mainline story experience provided by gameplay, holotexts, and chat-box interactions.

In side areas, lore books are often the primary method of storytelling. When this is the case, the page for that book will have a minor spoiler warning, which looks like this:

--8<-- "minor_spoiler.md"

## Basic In-Game Mechanics
Lore books typically take the form of a writable book, or a "book and quill" within Minecraft. ![[book_and_quill.webp]]{ width="24" }

Books are found almost exclusively in chests, on lecterns, and inside of item frames, in decreasing order of prevalence. On occasion, they will be written/signed books, which do not have the quill texture and do have an added glow.

Books within chests are the most common, and will typically appear in the center tile of the chest, as shown here. Sometimes, chests will contain only a book, but they may also contain other loot, as in this case.

When you hover over a writable/written book, it will show you its title. On this wiki section, you can find information about that book by finding its title, listed alphabetically.

Lecterns are the second most common type of container for books, and books on these can be read by right-clicking them.

Books within item frames will show their name when hovered over, such as the Stasis Subject Roster in this image. They can be obtained by punching (left-clicking) them while in Survival or Adventure mode.



## Wiki Formatting
On this wiki, all book pages are formatted uniformly, according to the following template:

```markdown
# Title
The title of the book.

## Spoilers
Any spoiler warnings will go here, at the beginning of the page just after the title. If there are potential major story spoilers, then an image of a large, forboding door should block your view of the article without scrolling down, ensuring that you have proper time to react to the spoiler warning and click off if you do not want spoilers. After this image, any additional spoiler tags about specific areas or in-game benchmarks will be applied as necessary.

For example, here is what the beginning of a page with spoilers for the 50% completion story event would look like (there are not actually any spoilers on this index page):

--8<-- "spoiler.md"

--8<-- "50_spoiler.md"

## Summary
Next, a short summary of the book is provided, including a written description of its location in the world and a synopsis of its contents (if necessary). This section will almost always link to another article on the wiki, usually the section of the region or specific location within which the book is found. It will also state the type of container the book is found in.

## Coordinates
| **X** | **Y** | **Z** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
|  778  |  106  |  688  |

First, a table with the unique x, y, and z coordinates of the book's container is provided. Note that two books may have the same coordinates if they are in different dimensions (although this kind of conflict is very unlikely).


If the book is very short or has no real interesting content, only the location is provided in this section.

## Transcription

## Get Reading!

That should be all you need to know about this tab of the wiki! As always, be very mindful of the spoiler warnings if you have not completed the map yourself.
