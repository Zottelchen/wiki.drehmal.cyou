### Location/Summary:
This book can be found in a chest by the portal to [[Faehrcyle]] in [[Lai's Domain]]. It serves as a hint to the player as to the mechanism for opening Drehmal-[[Lo'Dahr]] portals.

### Transcription:
> Oh great Lai, hear my plea! I beg of ye to open this portal, to allow me my pilgrimage into Drehmal. I know I do not have the required amethyst, but I am nothing more than a poor beggar. Please, hear my cry!
