### Transcription:
> Although we are few, the Parables persist. And as the Parables persist, the faith of the Serpent shall continue until They wake once more. Dear traveler, welcome to Drehua. We encourage you to follow the path until its end and stay for a teaching or two in the Courtyard of Tranquility. And remember, the Serpent is long; feel free to leave an offering by any depiction of Their form throughout this Realm, and your feelings will gladden Their slumber.
>
> Thank you for your love.
