!!! info "Note: This book is removed content, which does not appear in the current version of the map (1.20.1). It is still on this wiki because it provides some intriguing insight into the lore of the world for those interested, but should not necessarily be taken as canon."

This book is not currently on the map, but could be found in a chest at Esipelli Vineyard in western [[Akhlo'Rohma]]. It describes a cornflower blooming early and seeming to establish a psychic hold over the author, who becomes obsessed with maintaining it. It contains the exact same text as [[Previous Cultivator's Findings]] in [[Dusps]], with the exception of capitalized month abbreviations.

## Transcription
> Virma. 17
> A lone cornflower bloomed earlier than most this year, the rest still budded as summer isn't quite upon us. My volunteer, Deoan, recommended I trim it for the sake of consistency, and they have a better eye for presentation than me.
>
> Virma. 26
> I’ve had to keep rolling the compost bins more as heat grows on the plateau, but as Deoan is not used to the practice yet, they left a clamp slack on the lid and the contents spilled on the pathway. What struck me more was the appearance of a cornflower, still crisp and unmatted. It felt warm, not like that of the decomposing flora, but sunkissed and alive.

> Deoan mentioned just beheading the thing, but something in me aches at the thought. Even grasping the shears near it sends me into a tizzy. I’ve had to set them in charge for the time being as I don’t think I’m fit for it right now. I swear I saw his stigma wink.

> To kill him now does him a disservice at having thrived so long, but who’s to say how long his good fortune lasts. He demands a keeper, someone only meant to keep him safe. With my shears dulled, I’m only left to prune.
