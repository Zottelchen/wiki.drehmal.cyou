# Races of Drehmal

The realm of Drehmal contains at least five distinct humanoid races, all of which can be found and interacted with in game to some extent.

## Main Races

[[Drehmari]]: The dominant humanoid race, replacing standard villagers.

[[Maelmari]]: Ascended of [[Maelihs]], red and twisted piglin replacements who are hostile to the player.

[[Mihkmari]]: Illager replacements, hybrid offspring of Drehmari and Maelmari.

[[Tehrmari]]: Dragon people ascended from Drehmari, found in the [[Purity Peaks]] region.

[[Virmari]]: Ascended of [[Virtuo]], angelic blue people who are found very sparsely in modern Drehmal.

## Others

Beyond these main races, some others are mentioned in Drehmal's lore but not represented in the map.

[[Aspect Ascended]]: Each [Aspect](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) seems to be capable of ascending Drehmari to their own unique sub-race, which reflects their domain and physical characteristics. These are not seen in the map, but are referenced sparingly in lore books and in old lore references.

[[Neverdawn]]: The realm of Neverdawn, deep underground, appears to be made up of sapient spider people, who may or may not be derived from Drehmari like the other races. Their origins are very mysterious.
