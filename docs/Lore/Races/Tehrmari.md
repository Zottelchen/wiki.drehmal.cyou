> The 6 possible skins for Tehrmari villagers.

The **Tehrmari** (pronounced "turr-marr-ee"), also known as the **Aspect-Born**, are an ascended, draconic humanoid race. They are found very sparingly on [[Overworld|Drehmal]] by the time that the player awakens from stasis. 

They are re-skinned Minecraft villagers, and therefore have identical mechanics to [[Drehmari]].

Tehrmari were once plentiful throughout the continent, particularly concentrated in Tehrmia, the region now known as Purity Peaks. Historically, Tehrmari made their home on the divine moon of [[LD|Lo'Dahr]] alongside the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/). They made pilgrimage to the [[disc]] to spread the faith of the Aspects, Tehrmari were not a massive force in Drehmari politics, but their missionaries were not at all an uncommon sight.

Tehrmari are found on Drehmal exclusively in the [[Purity Peaks]] region, formerly known as **Tehrmia**. There are two places in this region with Tehrmari villagers: the village of [[Hevhlak]], and the [[Tehrmari Monastery]] in the eastern mountains.

The Tehrmari appear to worship many different Aspects, but broadly do not recognize the [Deities](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Deities/).

Tehrmari are the predominant humanoid race on the in-game location of [[Lo'Dahr]], where they can be found in almost all domains. Lore discovered here also paints a much clearer and more detailed picture of the Tehrmari's origins and society.

### Ascension and Origins

Tehrmari are created by the Aspects in a manner similar to how [[Virtuo]] creates [[Virmari]]: Drehmari who gain particular favor with an Aspect, or the Prismatic Council at large, were offered ascension to a higher level of existence. The Tehrmari take after the Aspects in their physical form, strongly resembling small, bipedal dragons in their upper bodies.

[[The Founders]] asserts that the three first Tehrmari would each come to lead a faction of the La'Tehrmari, the main ascended class of Tehrmari. The first Tehrmari was [[Tehra]], a very close friend of the Aspect of Pleasure, [[Moen|Kind-Wyrm Moen]]. [[Sereven]], a friend of [[Nahyn|Summit-Drake Nahyn]], and [[Froslea]], friend to [[Rihalae|Zephyr Rihalae]], rounded out the group.

### La'Tehrmari

The La'Tehrmari are the ruling Tehrmari order and upper class, made up entirely of those directly ascended by the Aspects. La'Tehrmari are functionally immortal, and live almost entirely on Lo'Dahr. 

The La'Tehrmari were organized into three major factions, which together formed a kind of theocracy over the divine moon.

#### Scalebound

The Scalebound are the clergy of the La'Tehrmari, proclaiming the Aspect faith and making most of the major policy decisions in Lo'Dahr. They are led by the Scalespeaker, who lives in the large palace complex at the far eastern end of [[Naharja]]. [[Tehra]] was the founder of this order, and the first Scalespeaker.

#### Talon

The Talon are the "peacekeeping" military arm of the La'Tehrmari, founded by [[Sereven]], its first Commander. Brutally oppressive to any that the Scalebound deemed out of line with the La'Tehrmari religious beliefs, the Talon were headquartered in the Aspects' palace of [[Ytaj]].

The Talon were responsible for perpetuating a functional apartheid system against the Ro'Tehrmari, and as a result, the majority of their force was wiped out by [[Yriel|Yriel, the Moonsworn]] in an act of divine intervention.

#### Wingmakers

The Wingmakers are the La'Tehrmari recruiting and missionary arm. They were led by the Benefactors, the first of whom was [[Froslea]], the founder of the Wingmakers.

The Wingmakers were responsible for seeking out Drehmari worthy of ascension, and were the reason all La'Tehrmari had to spend a year on the [[disc]], working to enact the will of the Aspects among the Drehmari.

### Ro'Tehrmari

The Ro'Tehrmari are a larger sub-class of Tehrmari, who have not been directly granted ascension by the Aspects. These Tehrmari are mortal, and were initially the children of La'Tehrmari. 

The Ro'Tehrmari have faced significant persecution under La'Tehrmari rule, worst around the time of the [[Divine Schism]] and its immediate aftermath. Following the slaughter of the Talon by Yriel, Ro'Tehrmari have come to make up the majority of most Tehrmari settlements, with a tense but mostly peaceful relationship between the two groups.

### Notable Tehrmari

Some notable historical Tehrmari figures can be found in [this folder](/Lore/Historical_Figures/Tehrmari/), including the Founders, [[Oriann|Dragonrider Oriann]], [[Amohn Aihura]], and [[Yriel]], among others.

### History

The timeline of Tehrmari history is not clear, but some of the major events are somewhat well-established. The Tehrmari were likely first made in either late Av1 or early Av2, as Lo'Dahr became the home of most Aspects. The La'Tehrmari order was the first to develop, with the Ro'Tehrmari becoming a prominent force as multiple generations of Tehrmari were brought into the world.

The lands of [[Rohei]] were inhabited entirely by Ro'Tehrmari, exiled from [[Naharja]] due to their penchant for engaging in gang warfare in the streets. Their religion differed at times with the La'Tehrmari, at one point recognizing worship of the [Deities](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Deities/) before returning to Aspect worship.

The La'Tehrmari and Ro'Tehrmari appear to have taken opposite sides in the [[Divine Schism]]. The Palaesidans, who held [[Ytaj]] until the end of the Schism, took Sereven hostage at one point, suggesting that they were more aligned with the Ro'Tehrmari. Ro outside of Ytaj were hunted by the Talon, with particularly high concentrations of Ro in the lands of [[Rohei]], encompassing parts of [[Nahyn's Domain]], [[Moen's Domain]], [[Voynahla's Domain]], and [[Dahr's Domain]].

Following the Schism, Tehrmari continued to exist in two distinct classes, although some Ro'Tehrmari were ascended to La through completion of the [Trials](/World/Post-75_Area/Points_of_Interest/Trials/). The Talon continued to oppress the Ro, however, and the Aspects, displeased, conscripted [[Yriel]] as their servant. The Moonsworn's most prominent act on Lo'Dahr was to wipe out almost all of the Talon at Ytaj, taking away the La'Tehrmari ability to continue their oppression of the Ro.

Today, the Ro are the dominant class of Tehrmari on Lo'Dahr, and are present in Hevhlak as well. The La still hold more political power, but are smaller in numbers.
