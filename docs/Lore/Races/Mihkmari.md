# Mihkmari

**Mihkmari** are a humanoid race in Drehmal, who are a mix between [[Drehmari]] and [[Maelmari]] according to the lore. They replace vanilla Minecraft's illagers, and appear identical to vanilla illagers. 

They are almost always hostile to players, with the exception of the Mihkmari at [[Port Solitude]].

## Etymology

The term "Mihkmari" comes from the [[Rihselch]] words "mihk", meaning "shit", and "mari", meaning "creation" or "peoples". Therefore, "Mihkmari" roughly translates to "shit people", and would be considered a slur within the universe of Drehmal. This stems from the fact that Mihkmari are ostracized by all other races in Drehmal, and would likely face significant racial persecution anywhere else.

## History

Mihkmari are those born from one Drehmari parent and one Maelmari parent. It is unclear when this sub-race first arose, but it does appear that they have never been fully accepted by the major civilizations of either race.

Forced out of society, Mihkmari turned to lives of crime, living as scavengers and bandits in the fringes of the world. 

After following significant persecution, the Mihkmari were led by [[Deigh]] the Dawnstrider to the [[Verdant Labyrinth]], a relatively uninhabited land far from Mael's reach. The largest concentration of Mihkmari can still be found in that region today.

Following the [[Fall of Avsohm]], Mihkmari settled in the ruins of [[Av'Sal]], thoroughly looting the fallen capital and building fortifications over parts of the rubble.

## Spread

Mihkmari can be found predominantly in the [[Verdant Labyrinth]] and the ruins of [[Av'Sal]], but similar to [[Maelmari]], maintain a presence throughout the realm in small outposts and encampments. Some of the more prominent ones include a large camp in the [[Ebony Veldt]], an abandoned mining town in the [[South Heartwood]], and [[Castle Scarstone]].

The Mihkmari in [[Port Solitude]] are unarmed, and do not attack the player. These are the only neutral Mihkmari mobs in the map.

## Extras

Ravagers, a vanilla type of illager, are renamed to "Grafted Mihkmari" by Drehmal's resource pack. The lore behind this is explained by [[Artifacts#Lomach's Warplate|Lomach's Warplate]], which establishes that [[Red Dawn]] experiments were able to twist regular Mihkmari into these massive beasts. They are, however, capable of re-learning speech and higher cognition.

***

While Mihkmari appear like vanilla illagers in-game, it has been suggested by developers and lore books that Mihkmari appear very similar to Drehmari, but with gray skin.
