# First Tharhan Empire

The **First Tharhan Empire** was a powerful state in early Av2, headquartered in the city of Elthun (near modern-day [[Tharxax City]]). It collapsed into the [[Six Tharhan Kingdoms]] in mid-Av2.

The only explicit, named reference to the empire is in [[Tharhan A Land of Conquest (Chapter 1)|Tharhan: A Land of Conquest (Chapter 1)]]. 

It states that the empire was one of the first to arise in early Av2, as the Tharhan Plains were among the first lands made livable again by [[Drehmal]] in their post-[[Felling]] reformation efforts. Centered in a city known as Elthun along the banks of the River Salah (a location now known as [[Tharxax City]]), the First Tharhan Empire rose to prominence simply by re-establishing agriculture in the plains, steadily growing until the beginning of the [[Deity War]].

Due to their proximity to the [[Empire of Maelihs]], the empire was forced to appease the [[Maelihs|Burnt Lord]], and chose to send their felons to [[Rhaveloth]] for conversion to [[Maelmari]]. Giving Mael soldiers for his armies was typically enough for the empire to avoid destruction.

Criminals convicted of less severe offenses were instead sent to the northern [[Ebony Veldt]], a barren savanna teeming with wild beasts, and left to die. Some would, but the survivors settled in underground caves, eventually developing into the underground fortress and city-state of [[Caer Adacia]].

At its peak, the First Tharhan Empire seems to have at least controlled all of the Tharhan Plains, including the modern-day regions of [[North Tharxax]] and [[South Tharxax]], and may have also controlled the Ebony Veldt, although they did not settle the region. Based on the location of successor states, they may have also had footholds in [[Mt. Ebonfire]], [[Anyr'Nogur]], and/or [[Nimahj Swamp]].

Over the coming centuries, possibly before the end of the Deity War, the First Tharhan Empire crumbled due to internal strife, splitting into [[Six Tharhan Kingdoms|six independent, warring states]].
