# Viruhn

The **Viruhn** (pronounced "vurr-rune") are an extremely mysterious ancient group that lived on Drehmal in the First Avihm. It is widely believed that their battle with the [[Maelruhn]] was the cause of the [[Primal Tree]]'s destruction and the birth of the [Deities](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Deities/).

## Known History

There are only two uses of the word "Viruhn" in the entire map.

The first is in [[Av3 902 - Time Immemorial]], a short note written by [[Maelihs]] atop the [[Burnt Palace]]. It simply reads:

> Khive, bless his wisdom, summoned my sister and I to Ytaj. He decided that after what I had found on my trip to Xivrhynt, he needed to confess. He told us what had truly happened.
>
> The Viruhn, the Maelruhn... they disgust me. They set in motion this sick world.
> My sister feels so much regret for something she never did. I wish I could comfort her.
>
> I need some time to reflect.

The second is in the book [[Memo of a Drehmari Devotee]] in the [[Crimson Gorge]]. This book professes Mael's right to rule, especially citing how he has been wronged by Virtuo, and implicates the Viruhn in his agonizing birth:

> Virtuo is an imposter. A lying snake. She abandoned us after the Tidal War and seeks only her own peace, purity, or perfection.
>
> Although I had begun to have doubts, the final straw came in a tome from the Palisades, written by the ancient Drehua.
>
> Although the words were cryptic, one thing was clear. It was a people called the Viruhn which were the cause of Maelihs's birth in agony. The resemblance in name to the Goddess is the proof that I had been badly misguided in my faith.

All writing on the subject beyond this point is speculation.

## Speculation

Based on this information, it is commonly believed in the community that the Maelruhn and Viruhn are the two factions whose battle caused the [[Felling]]. Due to the Viruhn's name, they are typically associated with [[Virtuo]], as suggested by the Memo, and would have likely inhabited the original eastern continent of the disc.

The [[Kiln of Virtuo#Karesh Signs|signs at the Kiln of Virtuo]] about the Bright Capital and Battle of Karesh are believed to be a reference to earlier Viruhn civilization, referencing the battle that destroyed the Primal Tree.

The Viruhn are also believed to be the original inhabitants of the legendary Bright Capital, their glorious capital city in the far east. The Bright capital was discovered by [[Avsohm]] via a [[Red Dawn]] expedition in late Av2 to still exist on eastern [[Xivrhynt]].
