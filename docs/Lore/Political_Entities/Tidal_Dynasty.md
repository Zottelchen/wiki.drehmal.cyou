The **Tidal Dynasty** was a kingdom in the far southeast of [[Overworld|Drehmal]], controlling the entire [[Black Jungle]] region for centuries under the rule of the [[Tide Queen]]. Over the course of its lifespan, the dynasty coexisted with both of the greatest powers in the history of [[Overworld|Drehmal]], the [[Avsohm|Empire of Avsohm]] and the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]], ending at the hands of the latter.
