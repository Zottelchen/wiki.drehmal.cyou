The **Tidal Dynasty** was a kingdom in the far southeast of [[Overworld|Drehmal]], controlling the entire [[Black Jungle]] region for centuries under the rule of the [[Tide Queen]]. Over the course of its lifespan, the dynasty coexisted with both of the greatest powers in the history of [[Overworld|Drehmal]], the [[Avsohm|Empire of Avsohm]] and the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]], ending at the hands of the latter.

## History

The Tidal Dynasty was established by a mysterious and extremely powerful individual known only as the [[Tide Queen]], who seized power in [[Firteid]] shortly after the collapse of the [[Empire of Vir]] in Av2 1359. The Empire of Vir had been the dominant political force in eastern Drehmal for centuries, and the Tide Queen took advantage of this power vacuum.

Early in its existence, the Tidal Dynasty was a peaceful, albeit stern neighbor. They had peaceful relations with [[Gozak]] and [[Espinor]] to the west, strong trade routes, and well-loved cultural traditions revolving around the [[Kiln of Virtuo]]. However, over time, the Tide Queen became more and more paranoid, turning her lands into an isolationist and oppressive state.

The Tidal Dynasty was the only [[Drehmari]] civilization in Av2 Drehmal which was able to dissuade [[Avsohm]] from invading or annexing it, as [[Drehn|Drehn Mal'Sohm]] and the Tide Queen came to a mutual agreement that they did not want war between their massive militaries. The Dynasty never fell under Avsohmic rule.

The Tidal Dynasty, exercising control over the southeastern waters, was also the only state with any reasonable proximity to the island of [[Sahd]]. In Av2 1753, the Tidal Dynasty effectively erased the island from history, isolating it from the mainland entirely in an act of retribution for the Sahdans sending prisoners to the Black Jungle.

Following the [[Fall of Avsohm]], the Tidal Dynasty may have been the most powerful Drehmari state in the world, being largely unaffected by the empire's collapse. However, the Tide Queen only grew more and more paranoid, eventually barring entry to all foreigners except for religious pilgrims in Av3 39. 

Tensions between the Tidal Dynasty and its neighbors would begin to come to a head in mid-Av3, when [[Insohm]] suddenly arose as a major player in [[Spearhead Forest]] across the mountains to the north. Beginning as a trade coalition, Insohm greatly disapproved of the Dynasty's extortion of ships in its waters. The Dynasty joined in on the [[Insohmic Civil War]] around Av3 605 after an Insohmic airship passed through its airspace, an act the Tide Queen interpreted as a declaration of war. 

Insohm, particularly [[Hovadchear]], disapproved of the Dynasty's increasing xenophobia and instability. In Av3 628, a band of mercenaries suspected to be the elite Insohmic Whispers infiltrated the Tide Palace in Firteid and managed to assassinate the Tide Queen. Without a ruler, the Black Jungle was plunged into the [[Tidal War]], in which [[Virtuo]]'s Grand Parish and the Tide Queen's top military officials fought for the right to rule the area, with the former (backed by [[Insohm]]) emerging victorious after an outside act of intervention.

## Society and Culture

While the Tidal Dynasty did develop a strong culture, it was also a very oppressive society for most of its existence. Traditions such as [[Wellspring Day]] were observed and beloved by its people, but towards the end of the Dynasty's existence, the Queen was seen as a tyrant by the general populace.

The Tide Queen operated on a very Machiavellian, strict code, outlined in [[Precepts of the Tidal Dynasty]]. 

Parts of the Dynasty's history, architectural style, and general aesthetic take clear inspiration from East Asian cultures, particularly that of Japan and China.
