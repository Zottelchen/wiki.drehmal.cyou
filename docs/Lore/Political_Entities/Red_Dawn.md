# Red Dawn

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Red Dawn** was an alchemical society, and a member of [[Avsohm]]'s Big Three, three corporations that effectively made up the higher branches of the empire's government. Red Dawn was responsible for many of Avsohm's most cutting-edge research projects, including some deemed too unethical or taboo to be public information, and their specific actions were largely kept secret by the government.

Red Dawn was headquartered at [[Azimuth Labs]] during the time of Avsohm, but the society itself predated the empire, and survived beyond [[Fall of Avsohm|its fall]] as well.
