# Red Dawn

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Red Dawn** was an alchemical society, and a member of [[Avsohm]]'s Big Three (three corporations that effectively functioned as branches of the empire's government). Red Dawn was responsible for many of Avsohm's most cutting-edge research projects, including some deemed too unethical or taboo to be public information, and their specific actions were largely kept secret by the government.

Red Dawn was headquartered at [[Azimuth Labs]] during the time of Avsohm, but the organization itself predated the empire.
