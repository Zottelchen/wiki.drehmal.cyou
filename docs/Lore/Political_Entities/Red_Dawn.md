# Red Dawn

> The Red Dawn banner.

**Red Dawn** was an [alchemical](Alchemy.md) society, and a member of [[Avsohm]]'s Big Three, a group of three semi-independent organizations that were brought under the empire's wing, acting as branches of their government. Red Dawn was responsible for many of Avsohm's most cutting-edge research projects, including some deemed too unethical or taboo to be public information, and their specific actions were largely kept secret by the government.

Red Dawn was headquartered at [[Azimuth Labs]] during the time of Avsohm, but the organization itself predated the empire and (to some extent) survived its collapse.

## History

!!! note "See: [[The Origins of Red Dawn]]"

Red Dawn was formed in early Av2, following the establishment of modern alchemy at [[Ancehl Castle]]. It was likely formed at some point in the Av2 1300s, around the time that its respective school, Asomatous alchemy, was established. 

Red Dawn prided itself on its willingness to reject the ethical code of Ancehlian alchemists, focusing entirely on the Doctrine of Spheres and pursuing whatever was necessary to attain their [[Alchemy#Great Work|Great Work]]. They appear to have had a presence in many different states, mostly flocking to whoever had the most power and wealth to support their endeavors.

The group was therefore drawn to [[Avsohm]] as it became a titanic superpower, and a mutual relationship was born. Red Dawn used Avsohm's funding and access to highly prized materials in order to power its own research, and the empire was able to utilize Red Dawn's expertise and experimentation to further its dominance over the realm.

??? warning "End-Game (Post-Yav Spoiler)"
    Red Dawn alchemists were instrumental in the creation of the God Machine at their headquarters, [[Azimuth Labs]]. This machine, Red Dawn's collective attempt at the Great Work, was designed to turn [[Anyr]] into a god.

Throughout the final decades of Avsohm's reign, increasing amounts of Red Dawn alchemists defected to the [[Empire of Maelihs]], often serving the Burnt Lord directly at the [[Burnt Palace]]. Most of the alchemists still connected to Avsohm [[Fall of Avsohm|died with them]], and these defectors were the vast majority of the survivors.

Of these defectors, the most well-documented (and seemingly most famous) is [[Klyhf|Klyhf Him'lahk]], an alchemist who slowly gained the trust of [[Maelihs]] and attempted the Great Work by sacrificing the deity. He was unsuccessful, and was killed for his infraction, but is remembered by other alchemists as one of the closest to achieving it besides [[Aok]] and [[Akim]].

Red Dawn does not appear to exist in any official capacity today, with its last members likely dying in the Burnt Palace or alone elsewhere in the realm.

## Locations

There are multiple locations in Drehmal where the Red Dawn banner can be found, including a small fortress beneath [[Highfall]] Castle and a massive obsidian tower in southwestern [[Anyr'Nogur]] with a [[Fervor Stones#Stone of Worry|Stone of Worry]]. 

Their headquarters, however, was the end-game [[Azimuth Labs]].

## Notable People

Red Dawn members and affiliates are referenced as very important characters in Drehmal's lore.

### Ahdul

Alchemical Secretary Ahdul was a high-ranking member of Red Dawn, who directly reported to Anyr.

### Klyhf Him'lahk

Although it is unclear if he worked for the organization during the reign of Avsohm, [[Klyhf]] clearly refers to himself as a member of Red Dawn, and one of many to defect to [[Maelihs]].

### Vohski Ottis

Stasis Eight member [[Vohski Ottis]] was not an official member of Red Dawn, but he did conduct [[Project Moonstrider|an experiment]] on their behalf, in their HQ. He did not seem to enjoy the experience.

## Extras

The name "Red Dawn", along with the other names of the Big Three organizations, seems to be a reference to one of the three [Deities](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Deities/). Red Dawn refers to [[Maelihs]], who is heavily associated with the color red, although the origins of the "Dawn" part of this name is unclear. The tie is strengthened, however, by the fact that Red Dawn alchemists are known to have defected to Mael.
