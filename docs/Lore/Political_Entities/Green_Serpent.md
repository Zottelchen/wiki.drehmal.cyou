# Green Serpent

**Green Serpent** is a trading guild, and a member of [[Avsohm]]'s Big Three, a group of three semi-independent organizations that were brought under the empire's wing, acting as branches of their government. Green Serpent is a mysterious entity, thought to still exist in Drehmal today. In the time of Avsohm, it made up a significant portion of the empire's economy, managing trade infrastructure.

## History

Green Serpent is the most mysterious member of the Big Three by far, as stated in [[The Origins of Green Serpent]]. It is believed to have existed well before the empire did, and it existed as the empire's commercial and economic branch, managing the funds of the empire and influencing its trade networks.

Green Serpent was the least affected member of the Big Three by the [[Fall of Avsohm]], having intertwined their identity with the empire's to the smallest degree. Green Serpent was able to continue their normal operations throughout the Third Avihm, and still exists today, protecting the [[Adventuring Merchant|Adventuring Merchants]] found in major towns throughout the realm.

## Locations

There are no known locations that are specifically tied to Green Serpent in the map, besides the stone building in [[Firteid]] where the book on its origins is found. This is believed to have been a Green Serpent building, at a time.

Green Serpent does not have a clear "headquarters" that serves as a major story location, unlike its two siblings.

## Extras

The name "Green Serpent", along with the other names of the Big Three organizations, seems to be a reference to one of the three [Deities](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Deities/). Green Serpent clearly refers to [[Drehmal]], who is in fact a large green serpent.
