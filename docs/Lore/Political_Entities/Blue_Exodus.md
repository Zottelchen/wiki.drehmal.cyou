**Blue Exodus** was a secret Avsohmic organization that was part of the exclusive group known as the "Big Three", along with Red Dawn and Green Serpent. It was a military and construction organization, taking contracts directly from the government.

Blue Exodus HQ was the [[Exodus Citadel]], an underwater facility located under the waters of Lake Nimahj. Today, the lake has dried up and the Citadel is only a remnant of what it once was.
