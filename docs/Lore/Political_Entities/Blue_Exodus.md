Blue Exodus was a corporation focused on producing military equipment and a member of [Avsohm[Empire of Avsohm]]'s Big Three, becoming an essential part of the empire's industry and deeply intwined with its government. Because of this strong relation, most Blue Exodus officials disappeared during the events of the [fall of Avsohm[Fall of Avsohm]], causing the organization's abrupt end.
