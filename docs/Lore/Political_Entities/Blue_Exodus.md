**Blue Exodus** was a corporation focused on producing military equipment and a member of [[Avsohm]]'s Big Three, a group of three semi-independent organizations that were brought under the empire's wing, acting as branches of their government. Because of this strong relation, most Blue Exodus officials disappeared during the events of [[Fall of Avsohm|Avsohm's collapse]], causing the organization's abrupt end.

## History

!!! note "See: [[The Origins of Blue Exodus]]"

Blue Exodus was born out of the town of Stromnar in the South Heartwood, southwest of the current epicenter of the desolation. This town was said to have a "long warrior tradition", and rose to prominence during the reign of [[Drehn]]. Blue Exodus was responsible for assassinating the final [[Virmari]] king of [[Highfall]], and earned a reputation fighting for Avsohm for being nearly unbeatable with the empire's technology. 

Emperor [[Ifeihl]], in his reign, slowly incorporated the group more and more into the empire's official government, until eventually Blue Exodus found themselves as one of the Big Threeâ€”corporations acting as extensions of Avsohm's central government.

During the reign of [[Anyr]], Blue Exodus was completely intertwined with the Avsohmic government, developing the empire's advanced weaponry and technology. Perhaps the most intertwined with Avsohm, they were the only member of the Big Three whose high-ranking members were unilaterally wiped out in the [[Fall of Avsohm]].

## Locations

Blue Exodus was headquartered at the [[Exodus Citadel]], a prismarine pyramid structure formerly located at the bottom of Lake Nimahj, and its [[Exodus Vault|connected vault]], the location of the 50% event. Today, due to lowering water levels, the Citadel sits at the surface of a lake in [[Nimahj Swamp]].

The [[South Heartwood#Ruins of Stromnar|ruins of Stromnar]] can be found in the map as well, southwest of the [[Rock Maw]]. There is not much to do here, but its architecture is notably very similar to the style used at the Citadel.

## Notable People

Blue Exodus operatives are referenced frequently in the main story as important characters in the empire's history. 

### Kahmas Tuhs

[[Kahmas Tuhs]] was the final acting leader of Blue Exodus, and seems to have been its CEO for decades before the empire's collapse. He is referenced across many books and holotexts as a highly respected general.

Kahmas is listed on the [[Stasis Subject Roster]] as an officer who was put into temporal stasis at the [[Stasis Facility]], and he is the only name on that list besides the members of the [Stasis Eight](/Lore/Historical_Figures/Avsohm/Stasis_Eight/) whose name appears anywhere else. His pod is found open when the game begins, and it is unclear if he is still alive somewhere.

### Kovis

[[Kovis]] was a Blue Exodus technician responsible for the initial forging of the [[Mythbreaker]] by Avsohm. Her expertise was specifically sought out by CSO [[Thresa Vera]].

## Extras

The name "Blue Exodus", along with the other names of the Big Three organizations, seems to be a reference to one of the three [Deities](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Deities/). Blue Exodus refers to [[Virtuo]], who is heavily associated with the color blue and famously left the continent, in an exodus of the Grand Parish from the continent.
