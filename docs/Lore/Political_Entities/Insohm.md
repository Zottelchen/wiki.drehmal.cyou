# Order of Insohm

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

The **Order of Insohm**, also known as the **Insohmic Order** or simply **Insohm**, was a large alliance/loose federation that dominated [[Overworld|Drehmal]] (especially the [East](/World/Drehmal/Regions/Eastern_Regions/)) during the mid and late Third Avihm. 

Founded by Masters [[Hovadchear|Hovadchear Myrik]] and [[Ultva|Ultva Utofal]] in the [[Spearhead Forest]] region, the Order united many of the states left in the wake of [[Avsohm|Avsohm's]] sudden [[Fall of Avsohm|disappearance]] in an attempt to return to the glory days of Avsohmic rule. Out of the many political powers that existed in the Av3, Insohm came the closest to replicating Avsohm's technology and territorial extent, but still fell well short of their predecessor's unity and prestige.

Insohm notably waged a long war against [[Maelihs]] and his forces in the West, fighting to reclaim the land lost to the Burnt Lord during the power vacuum following the [[Fall of Avsohm|collapse of Avsohm]].

Insohm fell into instability with the disappearance of its founder and original headquarters of [[Castle Hovadchear]], and was ruled for some time by [[Vahid|Master Vahid]] before it effectively dissolved with the departure of [[Virtuo]], marking the end of the Third Avihm.

Today, over a hundred years since the departure of its Goddess, Insohm exists in name only, confined exclusively to the Insohmic Commonwealth in southern Spearhead Forest and the lone airship [[I.C.S. Arbiter]].
