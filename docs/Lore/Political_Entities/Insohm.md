# Order of Insohm

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

The **Order of Insohm**, also known as the **Insohmic Order** or simply **Insohm**, was a large alliance of states within eastern Drehmal during the mid-late Third Avihm. 

Founded by [[Hovadchear|Hovadchear Myrik]] and [[Ultva|Ultva Utofal]] in the [[Spearhead Forest]] region, the Order united many of the states left in the wake of [[Fall of Avsohm|Avsohm's sudden disappearance]] in an attempt to return to the glory days of [[Avsohm|Avsohmic rule]]. Out of the many states that existed in the Av3, Insohm came the closest to replicating Avsohm's technology and territorial extent, but still fell well short of their predecessor's prestige.

Insohm notably waged many wars against [[Maelihs]] and his forces in the west, fighting to reclaim control of the continent from the Burnt Lord after the fall of Avsohm left a power vacuum in the West.

Insohm fell into instability with the disappearance of its founder and original capital at [[Castle Hovadchear]], and was ruled for some time by [[Vahid]] before it effectively fell with the [[Depature of Virtuo|Departure]] of [[Virtuo]], marking the end of the Third Avihm.

Today, Insohm effectively exists in name only, confined exclusively to a select few small locations, over a hundred years since the departure of its Goddess.
