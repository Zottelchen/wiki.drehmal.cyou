# Neverdawn

**Neverdawn** is a mysterious political entity or realm which potentially inhabits the underside and/or deep underground of the [[Disc|Drehmal disc]]. Only seen in-map at [[Caer Adacia]], this group is represented by spiders and cave spiders. It is unclear if these creatures are meant to literally be spiders, or if they are really intended to be more of a [[Drehmari]]-spider hybrid, but they are heavily implied to be sapient and relatively advanced.

The [[Artifacts#Frontier's Edge|Frontier's Edge]] artifact is an explicit reference to Neverdawn, recounting a time that the [[Mari|Aspect of Drehmari, Mari]], recounted the pre-[[Felling]] history of the world to their people:

> This ceremonial pickaxe was the symbol of the Underliege's rule in the realm of Neverdawn. It is said that Mari's visit so impressed Az'Kaneev the Studious that he granted him this artifact in exchange for telling the court the entire history of the Realm before the Primal Tree's fall.

The [[Artifacts#Steelspinner|Steelspinner]] artifact also appears to be a reference to Neverdawn, suggesting that Neverdawn lies much deeper underground than even the deeper caverns found in the map.

> Only the bravest of the Seldom-Seen are assigned to watch over the caverns so close to the surface. To protect the throne of the Underliege from probing Two-Eyes is a solemn duty that is not taken lightly.

### Non-Canon Lore

The novel artifact from Drehmal's booth at the 2024 [[Smithed Summit]], Arbalest of Az'Radul, is very likely connected to Neverdawn:

> *The royal citadel of Az'Radul finished construction shortly before the swarm. The Weeping One made her nest here, furling her clipped wings and resting her weary, scabbed-over stumps. As the people of the world below amount their last defense against her children, they feel her horrible sobbing quake the very earth around them. Perhaps, she chose this roost to remind her of a forgotten home, a place to sleep above the deep sea of stars. And when she dreams, if she dreams at all, it is of a gift for those that brought her torment. A gift of rage. A gift of ruin.*

The name "Az'Radul" follows known Neverdawn naming conventions, and the "Weeping One" is likely referring to the [[Skullmother]]. This indicates that the Mother somehow made her way to the realm of Neverdawn following her release by [[Maelihs]] near the end of Av3, and her children (likely the [[Skullbeasts]]) ravaged the "world below", possibly meaning Neverdawn.

This artifact is very dubiously canon, as it does not actually appear in the official map.
