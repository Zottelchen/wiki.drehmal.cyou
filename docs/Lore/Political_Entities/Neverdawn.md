# Neverdawn

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Neverdawn** is a mysterious political entity or realm which potentially inhabits the underside and/or deep underground of the [[Disc|Drehmal disc]]. Only seen in-map at [[Caer Adacia]], this group is represented by spiders and cave spiders. It is unclear if these creatures are meant to literally be spiders, or if they are really intended to be more of a [[Drehmari]]-spider hybrid, but they are heavily implied to be sapient and relatively advanced.

The [[Artifacts#Frontier's Edge|Frontier's Edge]] artifact is an explicit reference to Neverdawn, recounting a time that the [[Mari|Aspect of Drehmari, Mari]], recounted the pre-[[Felling]] history of the world to their people:

> This ceremonial pickaxe was the symbol of the Underliege's rule in the realm of Neverdawn. It is said that Mari's visit so impressed Az'Kaneev the Studious that he granted him this artifact in exchange for telling the court the entire history of the Realm before the Primal Tree's fall.

The [[Artifacts#Steelspinner|Steelspinner]] artifact also appears to be a reference to Neverdawn, suggesting that Neverdawn lies much deeper underground than even the deeper caverns found in the map.
