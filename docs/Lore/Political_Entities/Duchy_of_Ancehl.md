The Dominion of Ancehl was a Kingdom that Ruled [[Akhlo'Rohma]] from c. the Av2 1300s to c. Av3 100, with a 200 year gap when [[Empire of Avsohm|Avsohm]] ruled Akhlo'Rohma. It was formed by separatists from the [[Chosen Kingdom]], who took over land from small tribes and kingdoms that previously ruled the region. It was well known for being a bastion of trade, all the while being a hotspot for racism and xenophobia. This ultimately lead to its downfall, when it was overthrown in a rebellion by oppressed [[Casai|Casain]] [[The Casain Migration & Its Impact|migrants]].

## In the Map

In the map, evidence of Ancehl is found in various locations throughout Akhlo'Rohma. Two major locations include the ruins of Ancehl, located on a plateau on a peninsula overlooking the [[Resting River]] to the south. The other major location is [[the Crypts of Akhlo'Rohma]], which were built by Avsohm during the 200 year interlude.
