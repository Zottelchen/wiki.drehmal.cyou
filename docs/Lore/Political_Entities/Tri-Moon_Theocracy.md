The Tri-Moon Theocracy was a theocratic state in Lorahn'Kahl that lasted several centuries in the Second Avihm, predating [[Avsohm]]. It was formed by outcast [[Necromancy|necromancers]] who worshiped the trinity of moons Lorahn, Loruhn and Lo'Dahr, and it was an enemy to both of its geographical neighbors; the Empire of Avsohm and [[Empire of Maelihs]]. Because of this tension, several armed conflicts centered around the Theocracy occurred in the early Av2 1700s.

## Formation

The practice of necromancy was viewed with disdain within the [[Chosen Kingdom]] of the Central Plains. In Av2 1383, there was a mass exodus of necromancers from the Chosen Kingdom, spreading throughout the continent to escape persecution. A devout alchemist named Raene had ascended to her first three spheres on her [alchemical](/Lore/Magic/Alchemy/) journey. Her spiritual projection sat on the three moons for three years each in deep meditation. During this time, she found interest in necromancy and theorized the Necrotic Engines, constructs that could rapidly kill and resurrect groups of sacrifices. By repeatedly killing and reviving one prisoner, she emanated a whisper heard by every necromancer, summoning them to congregate in Lorahn'Kahl and pursue the [[Great Work]] together. This heralded the foundation of the Tri-Moon Theocracy and their grand city, Sal'Lorahn ("city of Lorahn").

## Conflicts

The early years of the Theocracy were mostly peaceful. Children given up by paid families as well as prisoners were sacrificed to Necrotic Engines to produce legions of undead laborers, who were made responsible for many jobs that would otherwise be undertaken by living people (although, if the undead were put through a loop of death and rebirth too many times, soul depletion became a problem). The Chosen Kingdom evolved into the Avsohmic Empire, which spread its anti-necromancy sentiment as it expanded throughout [[Overworld|Drehmal]]. Avsohm took small amounts of the Tri-Moon Theocracy's territory in Lorahn'Kahl in order to mine the durable, crystalline rocks of the region. [[Maelmari]] would also occasionally raid the area. However, the situation escalated in the early Av2 1700s when Maelihs began ordering small invasions of the Theocracy from the sea. Avsohm set up a line of defense on their border in case Maelihs successfully occupied Lorahn'Kahl, which would pose a threat to their land in Palisade's Heath. In retaliation to Maelihs's attacks, the Tri-Moon Theocracy used their Necrotic Engines to raise an immense army of undead soldiers to combat the Maelmari forces.

## Collapse and Aftermath

Avsohm, trying to prevent aggression against their own empire or a war with Maelihs (which could result in his success), covertly supported assassinations of the Theocracy's High Priests. After the subsequent collapse of their government, Avsohm quickly invaded and occupied all of Lorahn'Kahl. The undead army, with an uncontrollable bloodlust, escaped captivity. With the most powerful necromancers now dead at the hands of Avsohm, they were free to embark on a deadly and destructive rampage across Lorahn'Kahl, soon spreading to the southern Tharhan Plains and approaching the Central Plains. Surviving necromancers convened one final time at an underground church, beneath the skeleton of a Skullbeast, the same site where Saint Raene put a captive through a necromantic loop in order to call out to all allies. Here, the Theocracy was officially disbanded. The incoming undead posed a major problem for Avsohm, who had to engage in a costly war with the loose, bloodthirsty hordes. All Necrotic Engines in Lorahn'Kahl were destroyed, except for those hidden in the [[Moonlight Sanctum]]. Eventually, the Undead Horde was eradicated, but [[Ifeihl|Emperor Ifeihl]]'s decline in popularity continued nonetheless in part due to his poor management of this battle, and the conflict ultimately paved the way for [[Anyr|Uffeihl Anyr]]'s rise to power.
