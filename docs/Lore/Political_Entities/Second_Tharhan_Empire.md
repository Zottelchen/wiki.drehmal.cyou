The **Second Tharhan Empire** was the successor to the [[First Tharhan Empire]], formed out of the [[Six Tharhan Kingdoms]] and headquartered in [[Caer Adacia]]. It was born in the [[War of Unification]], as Caer Adacia's Nightwalkers entered the war between the Six Kingdoms and Casai, defeating both.

This empire would effectively fall after being annexed by [[Avsohm]].

## History

The people of [[Caer Adacia]] began as exiled prisoners from the [[First Tharhan Empire]] of the early Second Avihm, sent out into the wilderness of the Ebony Veldt to die. Instead, they settled in a massive underground cave, spending centuries in hiding and developing a unique culture and military prowess.

The [[War of Unification]] was just the opportunity that Caer Adacia was waiting for. As the [[Casain Empire]] pushed into Tharhan and seemed to be defeating the six kingdoms' temporary coalition, Caer Adacia's Nightwalkers emerged from underground and took on both armies. They were able to successfully repel the invaders and cut down the individual Tharhan kingdoms, claiming the entirety of the plains for themselves in under a month of conquest.

Caer Adacia's leader, Tiderra I, was crowned the first Empress of the Second Tharhan Empire, on the same night that the empire officially signed a peace treaty with the Casains, allowing them to remain in Anyr'Nogur as a trade partner and tentative ally to Tharhan.

The Second Tharhan Empire would thrive for centuries, modernizing and unifying one of the most diverse lands in all of Drehmal through a series of civil reforms. The Empire maintained peace in the west even longer by establishing an alliance with West [[Merijool]], to the dismay of Casai.

This Tharhan golden age would not last forever, as the technological might of [[Avsohm]] was simply too much for the empire to stand up against. Even as a relatively advanced power, the Empress realized that her forces stood no chance against Avsohm's incredibly advanced laser weaponry, and allowed the empire to be subsumed into [[Drehn|Drehn Mal'Sohm]]'s growing beast, the defining power of the Second Avihm.

## Society and Culture

The people of Caer Adacia, and by extension the people of the Second Tharhan Empire, followed a matriarchy, in which only women were ever appointed as the leader. These Tharhan Empresses ruled with strong authority, but were generally perceived to be fair to their subjects.

### Nightwalkers

The Tharhan Empresses' might came primarily from the Nightwalkers, a feared band of enforcers (presumably [[arcanism|arcanists]]) who were clad in black armor. Known to enact their vengeance in the night, a piece of their armor can be found in-game as [[Penumbra]], the legendary leggings found in Caer Adacia. These pants make their wearer stronger at night, possibly insinuating that the Nightwalkers devised arcane tricks to make themselves faster and stronger in the darkness.
