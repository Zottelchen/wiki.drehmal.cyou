# Second Tharhan Empire

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

The **Second Tharhan Empire** was the successor to the [[First Tharhan Empire]], formed out of the [[Six Tharhan Kingdoms]] and headquartered in [[Caer Adacia]]. It was formed in mid-late Av2, when Caer Adacia's forces emerged from the underground to push back the invaders from the [[Casain Empire]], and established control over the Tharhan Plains.

This empire would effectively fall after being annexed by [[Avsohm]].
