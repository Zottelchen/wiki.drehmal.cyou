# Maelruhn

The **Maelruhn** (pronounced "mail-rune") are an extremely mysterious ancient group that lived on Drehmal in the First Avihm. It is widely believed that their battle with the [[Viruhn]] was the cause of the [[Primal Tree]]'s destruction and the birth of the [Deities](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Deities/).

The only mention of the Maelruhn by name is in [[Av3 902 - Time Immemorial]], a short note written by [[Maelihs]] atop the [[Burnt Palace]]. It simply reads:

> Khive, bless his wisdom, summoned my sister and I to Ytaj. He decided that after what I had found on my trip to Xivrhynt, he needed to confess. He told us what had truly happened.
>
> The Viruhn, the Maelruhn... they disgust me. They set in motion this sick world.
> My sister feels so much regret for something she never did. I wish I could comfort her.
>
> I need some time to reflect.

All writing on the subject beyond this point is speculation.

## Speculation

Based on this information, as well as one other mention of the Viruhn, it is commonly believed in the community that the Maelruhn and Viruhn are the two factions whose battle caused the [[Felling]]. Due to the Maelruhn's name, they are typically associated with [[Maelihs]], and would have likely inhabited the original western continent of the disc.

Based on the current state of Western [[Xivrhynt]], the Maelruhn seem to have been almost completely wiped out, but may have survived in small pockets.

The [[Burnt Palace#Tree Memorial Sign|signs at the Burnt Palace]] which reference the Bright Capital are believed to be a remnant of Maelruhn civilization, referencing their feud with the Viruhn.
