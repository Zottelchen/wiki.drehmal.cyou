# Ancient Drehua

The **Drehua** people were an ethnic group and civilization living in modern-day [[Palisades Heath]] in the late First and early Second Avihms, some of the only [[Drehmari]] survivors of the [[Felling]].

Surviving Drehuan accounts of early Av2 are among the oldest living texts in modern Drehmal, found at [[Drehua Temple]], a structure which has stood in some form for over 2500 years. The Drehua are also the only reliable primary sources of [[Drehmal]]'s activity in the first decades of Av2, with at least four written accounts showcasing interactions that members of the group had with the serpent deity.

## Parables

The four [[Drehua Temple#The Parables|Parables]] found at the Temple are written accounts of interactions that members of the Temple had with Drehmal themselves.

[[Ehrudei's Teachings]], or the **Parable of the Lakebed**, is the first on the left, and recounts Drehmal teaching a Drehmari to take pride in their work, but to also pursue fulfillment through creative ventures.

[[Heixueh's Teachings]], or the **Parable of the Riverside Crag**, is the second on the left, and recalls the time that Drehmal convinced its author not to rob a Virmari traveler, and convinced them to lead a pious life of devotion at Drehua instead of a life of crime.

[[Shorusharoh's Teachings]], or the **Parable of the Orchard**, is the first on the right, and contains what is likely the last recorded sighting of Drehmal before they went to hibernate beneath the Primal Caverns.

[[Shirua's Teachings]], or the **Parable of the Stone Tablet**, is the second on the right, and contains a writing from the Drehua prophet Shirua, in which Drehmal convinced Shirua to teach the Drehua to write. This decision would ultimately lead to Drehua Temple becoming the leading source on the history of the early Second Avihm in the modern world. Shirua in particular would become a venerated Drehua prophet in future years, with some rumors claiming that she was a distant ancestor of [[Drehn|Drehn Mal'Sohm]].

## Deeper Knowledge

The Drehua are also referenced as being one of the only sources of hidden, deep knowledge about the ancient world. One example is [[The Parable of the Worm]], a book hidden in Drehua Temple which claims to be the true origin story of Drehmal themselves, beginning as a humble worm before being ascended by the [[Primal Tree]] in its final moments.

The author [[Memo of a Drehmari Devotee]] also states that they learned forbidden knowledge about the [[Viruhn]] from a tome in Drehua Temple, indicting the Viruhn in [[Maelihs]]'s agonizing birth, which would make Drehua Temple one of very, very few places that contains information on this faction. No such information actually exists at Drehua Temple in the map.
