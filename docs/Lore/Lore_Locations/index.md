# Lore-Only Locations

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

Drehmal is a very large map, but it is outsized still by its expansive network of lore, developed for years before Drehmal v2 was created or even conceptualized. This folder contains articles on locations which exist in Drehmal's lore, and may even be referenced in-game, but cannot actually be found in the map.
