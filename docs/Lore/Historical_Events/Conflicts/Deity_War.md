# Deity War

The **Deity War** was a massive conflict between the forces of [[Maelihs]] and [[Virtuo]] in the early and mid Second Avihm, ending in Av2 1000. 

Very little is known about this war, but it seems to have lasted for the vast majority of the early Second Avihm, starting no earlier than Av2 32. It may have begun due to Virtuo's disdain for Maelihs creating [[Maelmari]] out of the [[Drehmari]] and her [[Virmari]], countered by Mael's own hatred of Virtuo and her worshippers.

There do not seem to be any significant surviving accounts of the Deity War, although it is sometimes referenced as an example of ancient conflict and a standard for bloodshed. Particularly in the West (including the [[First Tharhan Empire]]), the Deity War took countless lives, and significantly halted the growth of Drehmari civilizations.
