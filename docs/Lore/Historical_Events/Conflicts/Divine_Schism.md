# The Divine Schism

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

The **Divine Schism** was the first and only conflict between the [Aspects](Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/), overlapping heavily with the [[Frostfang Catastrophe]] on Drehmal.

This conflict led to the only known Aspect deaths by the present day, claiming the lives of [[Noha]], [[Palaesida]], and (indirectly) [[Voynahla]], as well as the indefinite exile of [[Maen]].
