# Tidal War

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

The **Tidal War** was a conflict fought in the early-mid 600s of the Third Avihm, sparked by the death of the [[Tide Queen]]. 

After the Tide Queen's death, the [[Tidal Dynasty]] collapsed, and two forces were left to fight for control in the new power vacuum: the Grand Parish of [[Virtuo]], who was backed by [[Insohm]], and the Tide Queen's remaining military officials.

The war ended after [[Maelihs]] took advantage of the chaos in the region to infiltrate the [[Kiln of Virtuo]] and badly wound the Goddess, ripping one of her eyes from its socket. This attack on Virtuo reinvigorated the population in her favor, and the Parish would go on to take control of [[Firteid]] and the rest of the [[Black Jungle]], granting Insohm a new member state.
