# Dohval Civil War

> - **Duration:** c. Av3 100
> - **Belligerents:** [[Ancehl Castle|Ancehl]] vs. [[Dusps]] and [[Casai|Casain]] Settlers

The **Dohval Civil War** was a conflict in [[Akhlo'Rohma]] between the city-state of Ancehl and migrants from [[Casai]], resulting in the destruction of Ancehl besides its [[Ancehl Castle|massive castle]].

This conflict is mentioned in only one book, [[The Casain Migration and Its Impact]].

## Background

The [[Dune Wars]] in the beginning of Av3 swept Western Drehmal quickly. Drehmari in most affected regions were not able to escape in time, but the people in the far northwestern peninsula of [[Casai]] had enough time to flee, and did en masse. This mass exodus became known as the Casain Migration, and it led to large groups of Casain migrants settling down in [[Akhlo'Rohma]] in particular. The Casains founded cities such as [[Azaim]], and also settled down in [[Dusps]] in large numbers.

Akhlo'Rohmans, a historically oppressive people, did not all take well to this new minority group, holding special disdain for the Casains' worship of [[Voynahla]], the Aspect of Death.

## Events

The Dohval Civil War was the result of these racial tensions in Akhlo'Rohma, as Casain immigrants fought against the traditional power of Ancehl for their rights. In the conflict, the city surrounding Ancehl Castle, once said to be massive and extremely influential, was burned to the ground. 

Negotiations between the two parties created the Kingdom of Dusps, a new Akhlo'Rohman political body which recognized the religious rights of Casains, integrating them into Akhlo'Rohman society. It was also notable for effectively moving the center of Akhlo'Rohman political power from Ancehl to Dusps.
