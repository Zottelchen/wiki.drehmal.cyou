# The Fall of Avsohm

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

The Empire of [[Avsohm]], far and away the most powerful political entity to ever exist on [[Overworld|Drehmal]], met a mysterious and violent fate, marking the end of the Second Avihm. The [[Story Progression|main story]] of the map often revolves around uncovering the truth of what happened to Avsohm and why, and this article contains an account of the empire's death.

This information is designed to be learned in-game over the course of nearly the entire story, so be advised that if you have not completed the story, much of this information may be new to you, likely spoiling the experience of playing the game yourself.

## Spoiler-Friendly Synopsis

Avsohm was the single greatest power in Drehmal's history, using their technological dominance to rule over nearly the entire continent for the last 2-3 centuries of the Second Avihm. They seemed to be destined to rule over the entire realm for as long as they pleased, up until one day in Av2 1820.

Within the course of this singular day, approximately 75% of Avsohm's top government officials, military officers, and other high brass mysteriously disappeared, with various accounts describing a series of extremely bizarre events on the day of the fall. These include apocalyptic storms, sightings and rumors of twisted monsters and ominous figures, and Avsohmic buildings found riddled with perfectly circular holes. A particularly high amount of attention is pointed at Avsohm's secretive actions around [[Mt. Yavhlix]], where the empire's doom may have begun.

With the empire's infrastructure crippled, [[Maelihs]] launched a long-awaited war on the west with his most vicious designs, the [[Skullbeasts]], and reclaimed almost all of western Drehmal with almost no resistance. Elsewhere, regional leaders were suddenly heads of state once again, with no greater banner to unite the Drehmari race. Anything related to Avsohm became taboo, and many cultures tried to distance themselves from the fallen empire as quickly as they could.

In the coming years, some would try to recreate the unity and strength that the Drehmari once felt under Avsohm, with the [[Insohm|Insohmic Order]] coming the closest. Ultimately, none would succeed, and nobody would even come particularly close to replicating Avsohm's technological prowess ever again.

## Background

The Empire of Avsohm was an extremely powerful entity, ruling almost the entire continent of Drehmal in the late Second Avihm (Av2). This power came primarily from their discovery of a massive tear in the fabric of reality at [[Mt. Yavhlix]], dubbed the "Spiral Anomaly" by Avsohmic researchers. This anomaly was releasing an incredibly high amount of [[Primal Energy]] into the realm of Drehmal. Avsohm harnessed this tear to power their empire and fuel their incredibly rapid scientific progress, but in doing so, began to meddle with affairs far beyond their knowledge.

A large, fortified [[Primary Energy Collection Facility|facility]] was constructed within the mountain to facilitate energy collection and distribution throughout the new empire, whose growth was rapidly spurred on by this discovery. Avsohm became the greatest political superpower in the realm's history, and achieved technological progress that was not replicated for the millennium after their collapse.

One day, the flow of energy from the anomaly greatly slowed down, and Avsohmic researchers first attempted to actually look inside the anomaly. What they found was the lost Aspect of Fear, [[Tethlaen]], who had been missing and presumed dead for over 1500 years, residing within the [[Nothing]] on the other side of the tear. They were able to form a working relationship with the Aspect, treating his extradimensional wounds in exchange for being given permission to keep siphoning energy for their growing empire.

Further dives into the anomaly revealed even more bizarre findings. Avsohm came to discover the existence of trillions of other realms outside their own, discovered an image of a spear which would become the [[Mythbreaker]], and were at one point interrupted by an entity from outside the [[Veil]]. Nonetheless, they continued pushing forward, with Emperor [[Anyr]] growing obsessed with the idea of ascending to godhood and ruling over a multiverse-spanning empire. 

The Apotheosis plan was developed and put into action, with [[Red Dawn]] secretly constructing the God Machine at [[Azimuth Labs]] and [[Blue Exodus]] preparing the Avsohmic military to wipe out their enemies on the day of Anyr's ascension. The Apotheosis plan was approximately as follows: 

Anyr would be elevated to godhood using the God Machine once it was ready. Someone would then take the Mythbreaker, in its inert form, to the Avsohmic facility at the [[Numencore]], the massive source of [[Primal Energy]] in the center of Lo'Dahr. Charging the Mythbreaker with [[Khive]]'s personal stockpile would surely anger the Arcane aspect, so Anyr would use his newfound power, combined with the might of the spear, to either force the Mystic Elder to stand down or slaughter him and any other Aspects who stood in the empire's way. Avsohm would use secret advanced weaponry and Anyr's new power to rapidly conquer the [[Empire of Maelihs]], with Anyr himself defeating the Deity in a duel. After the Empire had taken over Drehmal, the Mythbreaker would be used to tear a hole in the [[Veil]], and God-Emperor Anyr would lead his people to spread their empire to as many realms as they could possibly visit.

The main issue with this plan was the logistical aspect of the energy demand. Both using the God Machine and charging the Mythbreaker would require absolutely colossal amounts of energy, and the energy network on Drehmal in particular could be collapsed by the God Machine. For this plan to work, everything would need to be ready to go in perfect order.

## Events

The Fall of Avsohm began with the firing of the God Machine. According to the holotexts immediately surrounding it,

## Impact

A thousand years later, it is evident that the realm of Drehmal never truly recovered from the fall of Avsohm. Untouched Avsohmic ruins can be found throughout the map, often avoided by the survivors of the catastrophe due to whispers of a curse that destroyed the empire.
