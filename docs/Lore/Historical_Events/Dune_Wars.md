The Dune Wars were a series of conflicts fought between the Empire of Maelihs and unorganized resistance in the remains of the Empire of Avsohm, as Maelihs conquered the majority of West in the wake of [Avsohm's collapse[Fall of Avsohm]].

## Background

Maelihs had long desired to expand his empire during the Second Avihm. However, growth was restricted by other neighboring powers such as the [[Casain Empire]], the [Tharhan kingdoms[Six Tharhan Kingdoms]] and later the [[Second Tharhan Empire]]. When the Avsohmic Empire, an outspoken enemy of Maelihs, established a tenacious grip on the whole West, attempts by Maelihs to expand his territory would have been futile due to the empire's powerful weapon technology. The Empire of Maelihs did make their own advancements, however. Maelihs's scientists experimented with a gargantuan, ray-shaped beast, named the [[Skullmother]], for potential military use.

## Destruction of Sal'Anyr

After the sudden disappearence of Avsohm's government and much of its military, Maelihs took the opportunity to strike. A fleet of 52 airships escorted the Skullmother northward. She was first spotted by lookouts on the south border of [[Anyr'Nogur]]. They notified the remaining soldiers in the heavily fortified city of [[Sal'Anyr]] to the north, who prepared to counter an attack. The Mother's power was likely first unleashed on a line of Avsohmic defense in this area, alluded to by the dry, scarred landscape seen on the map, very similar to that of the modern [[South Heartwood]]. Eventually, the airships and the Mother approached Sal'Anyr. The airships were attacked by cannons and soldiers mounted on Kohlohmah (giant, domesticated vultures), taking down 4 of them. With the Skullmother positioned directly overhead, she opened her ribcage and dropped a gigantic clump of fur and bones from within onto the city, crushing buildings. She then leveled most of the other buildings by bashing through them. [[Maelmari]] soldiers exited from landed airships, and stormed and occupied the remnants of the city. This event is considered to be the starting point of the Dune Wars.

## War and Effects

Few details are known about the ensuing war. After Sal'Anyr, a city that was once regarded as an invincible stronghold, succumbed so quickly to Maelihs's forces, it became clear that it wouldn't be long until almost the entire West fell under his control. Many [[Casai|Casains]], anticipating an invasion, evacuated their homeland, most of whom fled across the Gulf of Drehmal to [[Akhlo'Rohma]]. This mass-migration would ultimately lead to the [[Dohval Civil War]] and have a lasting effect on Akhlo'Rohman history. Maelihs's armies encountered loose resistance against their conquest. During the war, they continued to utilize airships as well as employing destructive Skullbeasts, the offspring of the Skullmother. Toward the end of the Dune Wars, Maelihs himself was present on the frontlines to lead his troops. In the end, the Empire of Maelihs successfully had subjugated the Tharhan Plains (now renamed to Tharxax), [[Nimahj Swamp]], Anyr'Nogur, the [[Ebony Veldt]], [[Mt. Ebonfire]] and Casai.
