# Dune Wars

> - **Duration:** Av2 1820 - (unknown year, early Av3, after Av3 21)
> - **Belligerents:** [[Empire of Maelihs]] vs. Remnants of [Avsohm[Empire of Avsohm]], Other Resistance
> - **Leaders:** [[Maelihs]] (Empire of Maelihs)

The Dune Wars were a series of conflicts fought between the Empire of Maelihs and unorganized resistance in the remains of the Empire of Avsohm, as Maelihs conquered the entire West up to [[Casai]] in the wake of [Avsohm's collapse[Fall of Avsohm]].

## Background

Maelihs had long desired to expand his empire in the Second Avihm. However, growth was restricted by other empires such as the [[Casain Empire]], the [Tharhan kingdoms[Six Tharhan Kingdoms]] and later the [[Second Tharhan Empire]]. When the Avsohmic Empire, an outspoken enemy of Maelihs, established a tenacious grip on the whole West, Maelihs attempting to expand territory would be futile due to the empire's advanced weapon technology. Maelihs's scientists experimented with a gargantuan, ray-shaped beast named the [[Skullmother]], for military use.

## Destruction of Sal'Anyr

After the sudden disappearence of Avsohm's government and much of its military, Maelihs took the opportunity to strike. A fleet of 52 airships escorted the Skullmother northward. She was first spotted by lookouts on the south border of [[Anyr'Nogur]]. They notified the remaining soldiers in the heavily fortified city of [[Sal'Anyr]] to the north, who prepared to counter an attack. The Mother's power was likely first unleashed on a line of Avsohmic defense in this area, alluded to by the dry, scarred landscape, very similar to that of the modern [[South Heartwood]]. Eventually, the airships and the Mother approached Sal'Anyr. The airships were attacked by cannons and soldiers mounted on Kohlohmah (giant, domesticated vultures), taking down 4 of them. With the Skullmother positioned directly overhead, she opened her ribcage and dropped a gigantic clump of fur and bones from within onto the city, crushing buildings. She then leveled most of the other buildings by bashing through them. Soldiers exited from landed airships, and stormed and occupied the remnants of the city.
