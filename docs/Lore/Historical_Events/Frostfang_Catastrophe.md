The **Frostfang Catastrophe** was an ecological event in Av2 1646 stemming from a conflict between [[Avsohm]] and the tribes of [[Faehrcyle]], led by [[Homli Tahsgan]].

## Background

During the reign of Emperor [[Drehn]], [[Avsohm]] sent survey drones to the far north of the [[Overworld|continent]], and discovered a massive source of [[Primal Energy]] at [[Mt. Yavhlix]]. However, they were unable to reach the mountain due to the presence of the [[Faehrcyle|Faehrcylian]] tribes, who were not a part of the empire and were willing to defend the mountain from the outsiders.

## The Catastrophe

During a battle between Avsohmic forces and the tribes of Faehrcyle, [[Homli Tahsgan]] used a combination of the [[Frostfang]] and his own significant runic capabilities to create a massive blizzard, turning the entirety of Faehrcyle from a lush steppe into a snow-covered wasteland. Avsohm was briefly repelled, but ultimately managed to secure passage to Mt. Yavhlix regardless, as the tribes were forced out of their now-unlivable ancestral homelands.

Many other regions in the northern portion of the continent were also affected by the Frostfang Catastrophe. [[Merijool]], once a jungle, cooled into an autumnal forest and saw a significant shift in its culture as a result. ..
