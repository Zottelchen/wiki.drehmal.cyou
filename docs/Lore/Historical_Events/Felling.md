# Felling of the Primal Tree

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

The **Felling of the Primal Tree**, often referred to simply as the **Felling**, was an event in which the [[Primal Tree]], the first known being in the realm of Drehmal and the creator of all the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) and of [[Drehmari]], was destroyed. This event was an unprecedented catastrophe, leaving the land of the [[disc]] in total ruin and killing off the vast majority of its people. 

The Felling is known to have been incited by, or coincided with, a battle of some sort. This battle is believed to have been between the [[Maelruhn]] and [[Viruhn]], the two dominant warring factions in the First Avihm.

The Felling is the event that marks the end of the First Avihm (Av1) and the beginning of the Second Avihm (Av2), and directly resulted in the creation of the [Deities](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Deities/), who all inherited some amount of the Primal Tree's soul and memories.
