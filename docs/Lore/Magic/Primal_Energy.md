# Primal Energy

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Primal Energy** is a form of unique, highly powerful energy, with unclear origins stemming from outside the realm of Drehmal. Primal energy was used by [[Khive]] and the other [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) in the creation of the world, and its use by [[Avsohm]] led that empire to become the most powerful and advanced ever created by mortals.
