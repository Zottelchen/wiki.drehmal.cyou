# Necromancy

**Necromancy** is a form of magic pertaining to death, and in particular, power over death and the reanimation of the dead into undead zombies.

Necromancy on [[Overworld|Drehmal]] was most prevalent in [[Lorahn'Kahl]], being invented by the alchemist [[Aok]] and practiced widely in the [[Tri-Moon Theocracy]].

## Principles

Necromancy can be understood as a discipline of [[alchemy]], as it uses runic magic to directly manipulate organic matter. However, it appears to be primarily concerned with the ability to revive dead bodies and things, possibly including the more general manipulation of flesh, while alchemy focuses specifically on living things. This makes necromancy somewhat difficult to categorize.

Necromancers in Drehmal have been known to raise people from the dead, creating undead armies as well as exploiting death to create energy.

Necromancy is seen as a somewhat shameful, taboo field by other alchemistsâ€”a darker path that some choose to go down.

## History

Necromancy appears to have been invented by a mysterious figure living in the First Avihm, known as [[Aok]]. Very little concrete information still exists about him, but it is said that he is the first person to achieve the [[Alchemy#Great Work|Great Work]], and he is referred to as "The First Necromancer". It may be inferred from this information that Aok invented necromancy in Drehmal, but his true actions are not known.

The largest historical group of necromancers formed in the beaches and jungles of [[Lorahn'Kahl]] in the mid-late Second Avihm, initially exiled from the [[Chosen Kingdom]] in Av2 1383. Eventually, this group established a loose necromantic state in the region, known as the [[Tri-Moon Theocracy]]. Dedicated to re-accomplishing the Great Work through necromancy and heavily inspired by Aok, the Theocracy created a necrotic engine at the [[Moonlight Sanctum]], within the flooded caverns of the region. This facility was home to a few people who were repeatedly killed and revived, potentially generating some kind of necromantic power. Its exact purpose is still unknown.

The Theocracy collapsed due to interference from [[Avsohm]], who assassinated its leaders, and its horde of undead was released into Drehmal, presenting an issue to the surrounding regions for a long time. Since then, there have not been any clear attempts at re-concentrating a group of necromancers again.

Skull Disciple [[Ossein]] is likely a necromancer of some kind, having used "necromantic runes" in a ritual at the [[Birthing Grounds]] intended to revive Femura, a [[Skullbeasts|Skullbeast]].
