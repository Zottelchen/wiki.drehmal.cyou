# Arcanism 

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Arcanism** is a form of runic magic in Drehmal that involves the carving of magical runes directly onto the wielder, in the form of runic tattoos, scars, bone or antler carvings, and more. Its wielders, known as **Arcanists**, are considered to be less learned than [alchemists](/Lore/Magic/Alchemy/), but can still be extremely powerful on the field of battle.
