**The Ambition** is an incredibly vague and secretive alchemical act, believed to be the final step beyond the [[Great Work]]. It is not absolutely defined, but completion of the Ambition is believed by the community to make one effectively omnipotent, supplanting the [[yellow|strongest being in the universe]]. It is not clear if the Ambition has ever been achieved, but it is mentioned sparingly by extremely powerful characters. [[Aok]] is mentioned to have attempted the act of Ambition after completing his Great Work, but it is unclear if this was successful, and exactly what it entailed.
