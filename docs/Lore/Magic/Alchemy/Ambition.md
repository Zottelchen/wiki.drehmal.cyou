**The Ambition** is an incredibly vague and secretive additional level of alchemical power, a step beyond even the [[Great Work]]. It is not absolutely defined, but completion of the Ambition is believed to make one effectively omnipotent, supplanting the [[yellow|strongest being in the universe]]. It is not clear if the Ambition has ever been achieved, but it is mentioned sparingly by extremely powerful characters.
