# The Great Work

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

The **Great Work** is an alchemical concept, and the true goal of any alchemist. The Great Work is different for every individual alchemist, but it is frequently defined as the wielding of divine magic by a mortal, theoretically resulting in an effective immortality.

Only two people have ever been known to complete the Great Work: [[Aok]] and [[Akim]], although many others have reportedly come close.

The Great Work is one step below the [[Ambition]].
