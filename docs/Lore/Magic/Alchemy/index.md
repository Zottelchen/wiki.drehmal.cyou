**Alchemy** is the most significant, and most powerful, form of magic in the Drehmal universe. Many important figures from Drehmal's history were alchemists, and alchemy broadly reflects the technological progress of the [[Drehmari]]. Alchemy's role in Drehmal's magic system is best explained by the book [[The Arcane Alchemist]].
