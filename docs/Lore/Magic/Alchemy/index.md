# Alchemy

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Alchemy** is the most significant, and most powerful, form of magic in the Drehmal universe. Many important figures from Drehmal's history were alchemists, and alchemy broadly reflects the technological progress of the [[Drehmari]]. Alchemy's role in Drehmal's magic system is best explained by the book [[The Arcane Alchemist]].

Alchemy in Drehmal is very heavily inspired by [real-world alchemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy), an early form of science concerned with the transmutation of metals, development of universal cures, and the perfection of the human form through a [[Great Work]].
