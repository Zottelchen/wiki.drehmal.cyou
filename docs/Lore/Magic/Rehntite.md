# Rehntite

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Rehntite** is a highly potent mineral in the universe of Drehmal which carries extremely high levels of potentia, or magic ability. The material is also very compatible with runes, which can be used to furthermore enhance its power. [[Avsohm]] was able to achieve incredible technological progress (and consequently, great power over the realm) largely due to their discovery and understanding of rehntite.
