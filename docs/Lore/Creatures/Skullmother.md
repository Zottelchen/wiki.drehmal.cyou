# Skullmother

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

The **Skullmother** is a colossal beast resembling a [manta ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manta_ray), used by the [[Empire of Maelihs]] for much of known history. She is capable of massive, biome-level destruction on the level of a large nuclear bomb, having been responsible for the desolation of the [[South Heartwood]]. This is the only known time that the Skullmother's full destructive capabilities were used.

The Skullmother was stationed at the [[Birthing Grounds]] for an unknown amount of time and used to create [[Skullbeast|Skullbeasts]], but was set free by Mael in Av3 687. Her current whereabouts are unknown.
