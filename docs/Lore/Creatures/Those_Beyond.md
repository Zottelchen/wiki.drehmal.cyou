# Those Beyond

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Those Beyond** are extremely bizarre creatures which appear as dark orbs, and are capable of consuming physical matter by chewing perfectly circular holes through them. Most accounts describe a death to Those Beyond as people being riddled with perfectly circular holes from an unseen source, until they simply cease to exist.

The only known sightings of Those Beyond were within [[Mt. Yavhlix]], in Eastern [[Xivrhynt]], and in various Avsohmic facilities during the [[Fall of Avsohm]], being the method through which much of the empire's top brass was destroyed. They are believed to be creatures that reside beyond the [[Veil]], only allowed into the realm by tears in the fabric of space and time.
