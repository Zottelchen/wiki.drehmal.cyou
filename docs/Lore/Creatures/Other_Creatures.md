# Other Creatures in Drehmal

This page contains information on non-sapient creatures in the Drehmal universe who do not have enough information or relevance to warrant their own page.

## Grasswolves

**Grasswolves** were ferocious beasts created by [[Muhs]] before his death. These wolves roamed the countryside in packs, and were known to attack [[Drehmari]], even sometimes attacking small villages. 

Upon his death, Muhs split into seven Grasswolves, who killed off the last members of the [[Hunting Party]] besides the Tracker.

No detailed description of their physical appearance is given.

## Greybison

**Greybison** were large animals that roamed open plains in Drehmal, created by [[Muhs]]. They are occasionally referenced, but do not actually appear in the map. Drehmari are referenced to have eaten their steaks.

## Kohlohmah

**Kohlohmah** were massive vulture-like creatures native to [[Anyr'Nogur]]. They were domesticated by [[Casai|Casain]] settlers in the region and ridden into battle, first used to raze the [[Six Tharhan Kingdoms|Tharhan kingdom of Avakea]] in the [[War of Unification]]. They would later serve as the inspiration for the [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] glider [[Avsohm'Kohl]].

??? warning "Post-75% Reference"
    A skeleton of what appears to be a Kohlohmah appears in [[Mari]]'s room in [[Ytaj]], hanging from the ceiling.
