In Drehmal: Primordial v2.1, this sequence played out when the player returned to the starting crypt/spawn tomb upon completing the [[Court of Nothing]] section.

> \[RETURN TO STARTING CRYPT\]
>
> ???: Congratulations. You've made it so far. Further than I had anticipated.
>
> ???: You must be dying for answers. You crave it and are truly insatiable.
>
> ???: Yet, there is one question lingering in the back of your mind: Why am I willing to tell you this?
>
> ???: Especially when I just showcased what happened to those who sought their own answers.
>
> ???: It's because you are insignificant. Infinitesimal. You are nothing but an amalgamation of atomic particles, concocted by an entity you can never meet.
>
> ???: You cannot pose a threat to me. The river of time that you drift upon has sealed its fate.
>
> ???: The pursuit for power is absolute.
>
> ???: It is the ultimate goal of any lifeform, be it through raw, physical strength, control over a dominion, to have power over their own unruly consciousness, or simply to fuel their biological engines.
>
> ???: But, what if there were a power that transcends power? The capacity to grant it and relay it to other beings.
>
> ???: I am that power. I am the cultivator of it, I sow the seeds of strength and might, mind and soul.
>
> ???: I give the fruits of my labor to those I deem worthy of it. With it, they may go on to preside over their own realm, with its own rules.
>
> ???: As you can imagine, there are an infinite number of beings that desire my metaphorical crown, and under no circumstance must that crown fall into the hands of the crooked.
>
> ???: Alas, I am getting ahead of myself. You came here for power yourself - so let us get you that power.
>
> ???: ‘The light unlike any other feeds upon a heart.’
