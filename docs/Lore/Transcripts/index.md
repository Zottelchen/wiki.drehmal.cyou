# Dialogue Transcripts

In Drehmal, the player will sometimes be spoken to directly through the in-game chat by one or more entities. This is almost exclusively reserved for [[Story_Progression|story]] encounters (and late-game story encounters at that), so be VERY mindful of spoilers in this section.

This directory contains all instances of such dialogue.

Transcripts related to Drehmal with no or minimal spoilers are found directly in this folder.

Dialogue transcripts from the 2.2 (current) version of the map can be found in the "2.2 SPOILERS" folder. These are all late-game spoilers.

Outdated dialogue, which is no longer canon to the storyline or lore of Drehmal, can be found in the OBSOLETE folder.
