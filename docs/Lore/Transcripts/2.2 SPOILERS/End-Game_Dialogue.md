The following is a transcription of the entirety of the [[yellow|Mythoclast]]'s dialogue in Drehmal: Apotheosis, from the end of the [[Primary Energy Collection Facility]] all the way through the true ending of the storyline.

## [[Primary Energy Collection Facility]]
> \*Player emerges from the Nothing after the vanilla Minecraft end credits.*
> 
> *A voice permeates your being.*
> 
> [???] Ah… it is done.
> 
> [???] Yavhlix’s seal, broken. The portal, now a fissure…
> 
> [???] …Tethlaen, slain.
> 
> [???] A ring of swords encloses the realm. Blood shall be spilt.
>
> [???] This moment was inevitable. One that I loathed.
>
> [???] You. You have seen so much. You have learned too much.
>
> [???] But… in these inimitable, fleeting moments, does it matter? Is there harm in learning more?
>
> [???] Return to the Terminus. I shall aid you in your final search for knowledge.
>
> *The voice vanishes.*

## Terminus (Post-Yav)
> \*Player returns to the Terminus via the Mt. Yavhlix tower.*
>
> [avSYS] // NETWORK LINKAGE RESTORED TO 100%! PERFORMING FINAL DIAGNOSTIC SWEEP… //
>
> [avSYS] // WARNING: UNKNOWN ERROR IN SYSTEM CONFIG //
>
> [avSYS] // ATTEMPTING SELF DIAGNOSTIC //
>
> [avSYS] // SELF DIAGNOSTIC FAILED, ATTEMPTING REBOOT //
>
> [avSYS] // REBOOT ERROR OVERWRITTEN, CONFIG ERROR UNRESOLVED. //
>
> [avSYS] // ADMIN PING UNRESPONSIVE, CONTACT ADMIN WING //
>
> [avSYS] // LOADING ALTERNATIVE BOOTLOADER, RESTARTING //
>
> \*The Terminus goes dark.*
> 
> [avSYS] // avSYS: DISCONNECTED //
>
> [avSYS] // REBOOT INITIALIZED //
>
> [avSYS] // ORBITAL TRAJECTORY: STABLE //
> 
> [avSYS] // MECHANICAL ARRAYS: ONLINE //
>
> [avSYS] // ADMIN BOOT CONFIRMATION: UNKNOWN //
>
> [avSYS] // avSYS: ONLINE //[^1]
>
> [avSYS] // CLAIM THE NEXT PIECE OF YOUR PUZZLE //
>
> \*The Silent Thing trinket is dispensed from the compass dispensary.*

## [[Azimuth Labs]]
> \*Player returns to the continent*
>
> *A voice seeps in from the reality around you.*
>
> [???] Of course, I wouldn’t make it that simple. Your tapestry of knowledge is a beautiful, miraculous thing. It is so vibrant and diverse.
>
> [???] Alas, it still lacks some of the most colorful, extravagant threads. Such priceless things must be earned.
>
> [???] Do not fret. I’ll make it worth your while. Something tangible is at the end of all this.
>
> [???] And perhaps, you’ll learn things that Avsohm never could.
>
> *The voice vanishes.*
>
> \*Player reaches the Sunken Astral Body.*
>
> *A presence creeps up your spine.*
>
> [???] Avsohm’s discovery and exploitation of Veilstone was a miraculous thing. What an ingenious use of such fundamental matter.
> 
> [???] Alas…
>
> \*A beam of energy manifests from the sky, destroying the veilstone seal on the facility.*
>
> [???] ...It is but an obstacle on your path to knowledge.
> 
> \*Player enters the tunnel to Azimuth*
> 
> [???] Don’t worry, I haven’t left yet. I’ll be right at your side until the end.
>
> [???] As you venture into one of Avsohm’s most secretive creations, I shall tell you a story about the empire and those that wore its crown.
>
> [???] Drehn Mal’Sohm’s first act as the empire’s sovereign was to raise the penalty for any attempt made on a sitting emperor’s life. Regicide.
>
> [???] Originally, it was a public execution. Drehn saw fit to make use of new torture methods, and so criminals were locked away in the old capital’s dungeon for weeks.
>
> [???] Then, when the criminal’s body and mind was thoroughly bruised and battered, they were sent to the gallows.
>
> [???] Emperor Ifeihl doubled their time spent in the dungeons. Emperor Anyr, eager to test new discoveries, incorporated temporal stasis.
>
> [???] Except, the criminal would only be halfway suspended, thus aware of everything around them but unable to move for the rest of eternity.
>
> [???] Clearly, the thing these men feared the most were their own deaths.
>
> [???] It makes sense, does it not? Any successful regicide would plunge the realm into turmoil and chaos.
>
> [???] Tell me. What do you think?
>
> \*Dialogue pauses, then resumes when player reaches Anyr's corpse atop the God Machine.*
>
>  [???] What a harrowing sight. The mangled corpse of the last emperor of Avsohm, sitting upon a throne of shattered dreams.
>
> [???] The sword was drawn, but it did not butcher the body—it merely severed a limb.
>
> [???] One thread remains. The tapestry is almost complete.
>
> [???] **Return to the Terminus**. Let us weave it together.
>
> \*A portal is opened beneath Anyr, teleporting the player back to the surface of the Sunken Astral Body.*

## Terminus (Post-Azimuth)
> \*Player returns to Terminus*
>
> [avSYS] // WARNING: UNKNOWN ERROR IN SYSTEM CONFIG //
>
> [avSYS] // RECEIVING UNKNOWN DATA PACKAGE //
>
> [avSYS] // NEW RECIPE RECEIVED FOR DISPENSARY //
>
> [avSYS] // DISPENSING… //
>
> [avSYS] // CONTINUE YOUR JOURNEY. RETURN TO THE SEAL. //
>
> \*Resonant Thing trinket is dispensed from the compass dispensary.*

## [[Resonant Halls]]
> \*Player returns to Mt. Yavhlix*
>
> *Thoughts that are not your own dominate your mind…*
> 
> [???] Your dedication is astounding. It has yet to waver. You truly are the last of Avsohm; both in soul and mind.
>
> [???] I only ask that you do not become blinded by it.
>
> [???] Allow me to explain by presenting a hypothesis from an old philosopher of your realm[^2]. Quote, “If reality is a deserted island, then there are three types of castaway.”
>
> [???] The first, and wisest, would carefully gather resources while persisting off as few as possible, and learn to farm and fish until being able to live comfortably and sustainably.
>
> [???] The second would simply indulge in the island’s resources to depletion, finding happiness before expiring on their own terms.
>
> [???] And the third, and most foolish, would build a raft with all the resources aboard in vain hope of finding more happiness elsewhere before being dashed to pieces against the waves,” end quote.
>
> [???] Where do you lie?
>
> *The intrusive thoughts vanish.*
>
> \*Dialogue pauses until the player reaches the entrance to the Resonant Halls.*
>
> *Though it seems incredibly distant, a voice is impossible to ignore.*
>
> [???] So… you have arrived at the heart of Avsohm’s ambitions. Within this place lies the penultimate threads.
>
> \*The veilstone seal explodes.*
> 
> [???] The seal is open, little descendant. Why don’t you come and see?
>
> *The voice vanishes.*
>
> \*Dialogue pauses, and does not resume until the player has reached the Resonant Eye, and turns around to leave the room.*
>
> *A voice compels you to act.*
>
> [???] STOP. Allow me.
> 
> \*A portal appears at the entrance to the room. Player enters the portal, and is returned to the Primary Collection Facility just outside the Resonant Halls.*
> 
> [???] The sword was drawn, the hand sensing peril; and so it took a life.
>
> [???] Now… your final journey is nigh. I suggest you pack well; your destination is further than you could even conceive of.
>
> [???] My Court. Other guests already await you, and I have even prepared a welcoming gift.
>
> [???] **Back to the Terminus** with you. Your journey will be over soon.
>
> *The voice vanishes, releasing you from its grasp.*

## Terminus (Post-Halls)
> \*Player returns to the Terminus.*
>
> [avSYS] // WARNING: REOCCURRING ERROR IN SYSTEM CONFIG DETECTED //
>
> [avSYS] // RECEIVING NEW DATA PACKAGE //
>
> [avSYS] // FINAL RECIPE RECEIVED FOR DISPENSARY //
>
> [avSYS] // DISPENSING… //
>
> [avSYS] // FINISH YOUR JOURNEY. RETURN WHERE YOU STARTED. //

## Return to the Stasis Facility
> \*Player returns to overworld.*
>
> *A voice manifests, breathing down your neck.*
>
> [???] At the heart of the mountain, through the realm’s tear, you slayed the dragon and emerged victorious.
>
> [???] Tethlaen, offspring of the Mystic Elder, spent thousands of years beyond the veil, subject to the endless torrents of primordial energy.
>
> [???] His body, despite having the strength of an Aspect, could not last forever while subject to such forces.
>
> [???] He knew that well and never faltered, for he feared nothing.
>
> [???] In the decades before you killed him, his mind deteriorated too, losing control of both himself and his role as the Ever-Fear.
>
> [???] Tethlaen had hope in the face of inevitable demise. Few hoped for him in return.
>
> [???] Far too few.
>
> *The voice vanishes.*
>
> \*Player begins descent back into Stasis Facility.*
>
> *An immeasurable presence looms close…*
> 
> [???] Oh, little descendant. How right you are.
>
> [???] Everything works in cycles. All that was made will return to its origin, within time.
>
> [???] Now, here we are. You must be wondering: Why? Why this quest? Who are you? You crave answers, your gluttony for knowledge knows no bounds!
>
> [???] I am the all-being. The overseer and adjudicator of reality, the titanic power at the center of creation.
>
> [???] I claim a trillion voices. I speak with infinite forked tongues. I strum the nerves of the primeval to meet the greater truth, to fulfill their duty to existence.
>
> [???] I am the cultivator. I sow the seeds of strength and might, mind and soul. Those I deem worthy are granted the fruits of my labor.
>
> [???] I am the imminent, the unstoppable. I am the hand that draws the sword. The blood gathers, little descendant. Make way for the new and unknown.
>
> \*Player enters the stasis chamber room.*
>
> [???] Enough of that. You tire of my eloquence. You want what is absolute. You want my name.
>
> [???] Then come. Step forward.
>
> \*Player steps towards the wall, which explodes and reveals a dark hallway, with a single yellow point at the end.*
>
> [???] I am…
>
> \*Mural is revealed, player receives dizziness effects*
> 
> [???] The Mythoclast <br>
> *Your mind goes numb…* <br>
> *Your body feels weak…* <br>
> *You feel submerged…*
>
> [The Mythoclast] I’m pleased to see that my name still has that effect on physical minds.
>
> [The Mythoclast] What you see before you is my self portrait. An artistic interpretation; my material form is… difficult to represent.
>
> [The Mythoclast] Now, go on. Claim your winnings.
>
> \*True Mythbreaker appears before the player. The player grabs it.*
>
> [The Mythoclast] Feel its strength. Its rule over reality… its raw, unhindered power.
>
> [The Mythoclast] It’s remarkable that Avsohm was able to forge it. Alas, it never existed in the first place; apophenia is a blessing and a curse, is it not?
>
> [The Mythoclast] Consider it my own rendition, personalized for you. Use it well. 
>
> [The Mythoclast] Before I open the way to my Court… be warned. This is your final journey. If you have any unfinished business, now is the time.
>
> [The Mythoclast] Time flows differently beyond your realm. The world may be different upon your return.
>
> [The Mythoclast] **Step through the portal** when you are ready.
>
> \*A portal appears in front of the mural.*

## [[Court of Nothing]]
> *You feel a cosmic weight on your shoulders.*
> 
> [The Mythoclast] Welcome, descendant. To the throne of constants, the flowing river of souls, the gardener’s shed…
>
> [The Mythoclast] …the Court of Nothing. Here, totality converges to be born again.
>
> [The Mythoclast] My guests are anticipating your arrival. Perhaps you already know them by reputation.
>
> [The Mythoclast] Come, then. Don’t keep them waiting.
>
> \*Player steps into the main room of the Court, summoning Ultva & Hovadchear. Upon defeating them, dialogue resumes:*
>
> [The Mythoclast] What a horrible fate that befell those two. I pitied them, bringing them under my wing, but it is time for their rebirth.
>
> [The Mythoclast] They are grateful to meet their ends.
>
> [The Mythoclast] I have another guest that you must meet. He has… waited for this moment for a long, long time.
>
> [The Mythoclast] He wishes to see the last of Avsohm. You.
>
> [The Mythoclast] **Step through the portal.** We are nearing the end.
>
> \*Player steps through the portal, emerging onto the Maddened Path.*

## The [[Maddened Path]]/Heart of the Void
> [The Mythoclast] Behold. The beating heart of beyond. At its center, my throne. Past its borders, the primordial nothing and pockets of chromatic fury. It is the seedbed of all things.
>
> [The Mythoclast] It is the heart to my mind. We drift ever closer, tidal forces tearing apart anything that comes near.
>
> [The Mythoclast] I hope you now see why Avsohm was subject to slaughter. They could not hope to comprehend the amount of power they stood up against.
>
> [The Mythoclast] They, under any circumstances, could have never been allowed to acquire such power. My… ‘crown,’ if you will. 
>
> [The Mythoclast] That crown must never fall into the hands of the crooked. They were not worthy, and no one will ever be.
>
> [The Mythoclast] I am the only being who fully understands such a responsibility. I am the only one with the strength and willpower to carry out what is needed.
>
> [The Mythoclast] Intervention is not something I do often. Avsohm made it necessary.
>
> [The Mythoclast] Remember that, descendant.
>
> [The Mythoclast] Your first emperor, Drehn Mal’Sohm, was an incredibly ambitious and hopeful man. He died before his empire became a titanic superpower.
>
> [The Mythoclast] Yet, his beliefs… his visions for what Avsohm could be. They never left the empire. They were carried on by his successors.
>
> [The Mythoclast] He simply wanted what was best for his people. What he thought was best.
>
> [The Mythoclast] Drehn made his own garden of poisoned soil and rotten seeds. He realized too late.
>
> [The Mythoclast] Your realm was so fraught with tragedy. So much unnecessary suffering and chaos that could have been avoided with careful foresight.
>
> [The Mythoclast] I especially feel for Tethlaen. They would not yield, despite my warnings. They were devoted to being the realm’s savior.
>
> [The Mythoclast] Tell me; if you were to plant your own garden, what would it become? What would you cultivate, how would it diverge?
>
> [The Mythoclast] Think on that for me.
>
> [The Mythoclast] …Now, as for my guest. We are well acquainted. He made a personal request to make this meeting happen.
>
> [The Mythoclast] Perhaps he intends to finish what he started. Or maybe he means for a friendly rendezvous? Ah, who could be certain.
>
> [The Mythoclast] Whatever it is, you will be freeing him of a burden.
>
> [The Mythoclast] I wish you the best of luck.
>
> \*Dialogue pauses. Player proceeds to the final arena, and dialogue resumes upon victory over the Emissary.*
>
> [The Mythoclast] Incredible. You gave him the final sendoff he wished for. His subjugation is over.
>
> [The Mythoclast] When he entered my Court as Drehn, he pleaded with me. He wanted to see the end of his empire.
>
> [The Mythoclast] He finally has.
>
> [The Mythoclast] You were, ultimately, the result of his ambitions. His legacy.
>
> [The Mythoclast] …alas, it is finally time. 
>
> [The Mythoclast] Where to go from here? What else is there to see, at the edge of oblivion?
>
> [The Mythoclast] The ring of swords has struck. Nothing remains. Do you wish for closure?
>
> [The Mythoclast] Come. We shall return.
>
> \*A portal opens in the center of the arena.*

## [[True End]]
The Mythoclast does not resume speaking until after the [[endcredits_transcription.md|end credits]] have played at the True End.

> [The Mythoclast] In their final moments, Drehmal sat here amongst the entropic dunes, gazing at the stars as their realm drifted through space to its last destination.
>
> [The Mythoclast] They were alone, the sole survivor in their bubble of reality.
>
> [The Mythoclast] Virtuo succumbed to the rapid decay at the edge of the world, never realizing their flawless realm of perfection. She never had the opportunity to forgive her brother.
>
> [The Mythoclast] Maelihs never left Lo’Dahr. He never returned to right his wrongs, destroy his palace, or visit his sister. After all the Aspects had died, Mael stayed in Ytaj and watched as the divine moon crumbled around him. 
>
> [The Mythoclast] The Aspects, after thousands of years, refused to mend the rift that put them at odds. Most of them perished while selfishly clinging onto their pride and egos.
>
> [The Mythoclast] But Drehmal? They were not filled with sorrow. They had no regrets. They did not fight back against the natural cycle of existence. 
>
> [The Mythoclast] They looked upon the devastated world they had created long ago… and they were at peace. They were satisfied. They were happy with the world they crafted, even with all of its flaws.
>
> [The Mythoclast] Truthfully, Drehmal never wanted to be a creator deity. They were born out of necessity, forged in the wake of destruction. 
>
> [The Mythoclast] Despite that, they were simply pleased to have been there.
>
> [The Mythoclast] They saw you at the dusk of the realm, the last of their children determined to keep on going, and thought:
>
> _**"Thank you for your love."**_
>
> [The Mythoclast] …And with that, I believe it’s around that time.
>
> [The Mythoclast] Do you wish to move on?
>
> [Yes] <br>
> [Not Yet]
>
> \*Player selects "Not Yet"*
>
> [The Mythoclast] I understand. Whenever you're ready.
> 
> \*Player selects "Yes"*
> 
> [The Mythoclast] Very well.
>
> [The Mythoclast] I trust you find peace in your next life.
>
> [The Mythoclast] Farewell.
>
> \*Player dies, and is teleported to the credits room, granting the "Closure" advancement.*
