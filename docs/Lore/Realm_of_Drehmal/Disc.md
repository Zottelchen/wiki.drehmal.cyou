# The Disc

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**The Disc** is the planetary body on which Drehmal is located, in addition to the theoretical continents of [[Western Xivrhynt]] and [[Eastern Xivrhynt]].

The disc is named as such because, unlike Earth, it is not a globe. Rather, it is a flat disc (or upside-down cone), with all of the habitable land being atop the flat surface of the planet, which abruptly ends at its edges, falling off into space.
