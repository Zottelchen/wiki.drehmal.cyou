# The Realm of Drehmal

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

Broadly, the **Realm of Drehmal** refers to the confined system of moons and celestial bodies contained within the [[Veil]]. This includes the [[Disc|disc]] upon which Drehmal and the hypothetical continents of [[Western Xivrhynt|Western]] and [[Eastern Xivrhynt]] are found, the [[Torahn]], and the four moons: [[Lorahn]], [[Loruhn]], [[LD|Lo'Dahr]], and [[Lo'Veruhkt]].

The realm appears to operate in a geocentric mannerâ€”the moons and sun all orbit or are positioned around Drehmal.
