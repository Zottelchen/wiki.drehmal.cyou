Broadly, the **Realm of Drehmal** refers to the planetary system of celestial bodies contained within the [[Veil]], roughly equivalent to Earth's solar system. 

This includes the [[Disc|disc]] upon which Drehmal and the (not in-game) continents of [[Xivrhynt]] are found, the [[Torahn]], and the four moons: [[Lorahn]], [[Loruhn]], [[LD|Lo'Dahr]], and [[Lo'Veruhkt]].

The realm appears to operate in a roughly geocentric mannerâ€”the moons and sun all orbit or are positioned around Drehmal, with the exception of Lo'Dahr, which is also stationary relative to the disc.
