# The Veil

**The Veil** is a physical boundary along the very edges of the realm in space, which prevents any observation or physical passage outside of the realm. Outside of the Veil lies the [[Nothing]].

The origins of the Veil are unclear.

## History

As far as information stated in the map goes, the Veil has always existed, acting as the natural border of the entire realm. Almost nothing is allowed to pass through it, with a few key exceptions.

The reconstructed text of the [[Codex Celestus]] suggests that [[Vayniklah]] and [[Voynahla]], the Aspects of Life and Death, respectively, have the ability to transfer souls through the Veil. Vayniklah is able to pull souls from their origin outside of the Veil and place them into vessels, where they live out their lives. Voynahla is tasked with ferrying the souls of the dead back out through the Veil, returning to the [[Court of Nothing]] to begin the cycle anew.

[[Aok]], the First Necromancer and first known Drehmari to complete the [[Great Work]], is implied to have the ability to transcend the Veil by the book [[Dear Aok]].

[[Avsohm]], in their later years under Emperor [[Anyr]], attempted to peer beyond the Veil, seeking to learn the truth of the universe outside of their realm. Using the Resonant Eye to peer into the [[Nothing]] through the Spiral Anomaly in [[Mt. Yavhlix]], Avsohm learned of the existence of trillions of other realms outside their own, varying drastically in size and all contained by their own Veils. This revelation, in turn, showed that the "stars" in the night sky were not actually stars, but rather, other realms' light shining through the veil. When Avsohm attempted to use a new set of Eyes on the [[Aphelion]] to look more closely at those realms, they were blocked by the Veil.

Avsohm was also able to recreate the fundamental matter that makes up the Veil, Veilstone, and condensed it into a nigh-unbreakable form, Condensed Veilstone. This block is the Drehmal resource pack's name for bedrock, placed by Avsohm to guard some of their most dangerous and secretive projects.

Avsohm's original plan for the [[Mythbreaker]], the only known weapon strong enough to break Veilstone, was to use it to tear a hole in the Veil at the edge of the realm, allowing them to explore and spread their empire to as many other realms as they could.

While the Veil does physically exist as a sort of bubble around the realm, the tear in the fabric of reality at [[Mt. Yavhlix]] can also be interpreted as a tear in the Veil, despite being well within the boundaries of the realm.
