!!! info "This page is about the concept and greater area within the universe of Drehmal. For the late-game story location by the same name, see [[Nothing_Island|The Nothing]] under the Story & Features section."

**The Nothing** is an extremely mysterious space that exists between realms, outside of the [[Veil]]. Full of mysterious creatures and massive pockets of [[Primal Energy]], the Nothing is completely alien and almost entirely unknown to the people of [[Overworld|Drehmal]]. 

It is ruled over by an enigmatic figure sometimes known as the [[yellow|King of Nothing]].

## In-Game

The player visits the Nothing through the Spiral Anomaly at the [[Primary Energy Collection Facility]], where they fight the corrupted Aspect of Fear, [[Tethlaen]], on a small [[Nothing Island|island]] (very similar to the vanilla Minecraft End arena). Killing Tethlaen allows large amounts of [[Primal Energy]] to seep into the realm from this tear, as established in the dialogue following that sequence.

Two locations in the end-game sequence are technically contained within the Nothing: The [[Court of Nothing]] and the [[Maddened Path]].

## Lore

Residing for long amounts of time in the Nothing appears to be extremely damaging to the body and mind of anything, as even Tethlaen, a god, was driven insane and greatly weakened by the millennia they spent trapped in this dimension. There are also references to bizarre, eldritch monstrosities residing within the Nothing, as Tethlaen attests to seeing "a group of creatures like bundles of wire in a purpled fog swim as if one entity" in [[AUDIO RECORDING DIVE 027]]. It also seems to be the case that the Nothing is home to [[Those Beyond]], the ravenous orbs of dark energy that played a significant role in [[Fall of Avsohm|Avsohm's demise]].

The tear at [[Mt. Yavhlix]] seems to be allowing the Nothing to slowly creep its way into Drehmal, with [[Khive]] believing in [[Codex Celestus]] that this will eventually spell the doom of the realm if not addressed. There also appears to be a similar tear in Eastern [[Xivrhynt]], where Those Beyond have also been sighted.

The Nothing is potentially associated with [[Aok]], as he is said to have the power to transcend the [[Veil]], is very likely referenced during and around the [[Primary Energy Collection Facility]] sequence, and also may be connected to Eastern Xivrhynt through the [[Artifacts#Leliouria|Leliouria]] artifact. Further writing on this subject is highly speculative.

The center of the Nothing is known as the Heart of the Void, a mysterious eye-shaped nebula of orange, yellow, and purple. It is from here that the King of Nothing rules.

Time itself is heavily dilated around the Heart of the Void, with extremely long amounts of time in most realms corresponding to mere moments near the Heart. It also emanates an amount of [[Primal Energy]] that completely dwarfs all other realms.
