# Eastern Xivrhynt

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Eastern Xivrhynt** is the name given to the mysterious continent located far to the east of Drehmal on the [[Disc]], only mentioned very sparingly. A remnant of the supercontinent that made up the world in the First Avihm, Western Xiv is mentioned only a few times in-game, and does not actually exist on the map.

Eastern Xiv is the far eastern edge of the world, where [[Virtuo]] departed to at the end of the Third Avihm.
