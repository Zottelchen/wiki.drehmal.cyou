# Western Xivrhynt

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Western Xivrhynt** is the name given to the mysterious continent located far to the west of Drehmal on the [[Disc]], only mentioned very sparingly. A remnant of the supercontinent that made up the world in the First Avihm, Western Xiv is brought up only a few times in-game, and does not actually exist on the map.
