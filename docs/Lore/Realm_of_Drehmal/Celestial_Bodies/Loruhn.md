# Loruhn

**Loruhn** (pronounced "low-roon") is one of the moons of the realm, best known for its vibrant colors in the night sky. Loruhn moves around the disc in a 16-day cycle, and is best recognized by its vibrant auroras (colorful lines across its body) at night.

## Mechanics

Mechanically, Loruhn is the most complex of Drehmal's moons. It appears over the horizon at almost all times, alternating between a barely-visible day form and a bright, vivid night form. It also follows a consistent path around the sky, and because it is the only moon that moves horizontally, it is involved in all eclipses seen in the night sky.

Loruhn sits approximately 26.5 degrees above the horizon.

### Day-Night Cycle

> Loruhn in the daytime.

Loruhn appears as a nondescript white blob in the daytime sky, shown above. It drifts slowly clockwise, disappearing just before 19:00 in-game time. At about 19:20, it fades back into the skybox as its night sky texture. It continues to drift clockwise in this form at night, fading out as the Torahn begins to rise at about 05:00. It takes approximately an hour for the daytime version of Loruhn to re-appear, around 06:00, and the cycle repeats.

### Orbital Period

Loruhn orbits clockwise over the top of Drehmal, completing a full loop once every 16 days. This period begins as soon as the player emerges from the [[Stasis Facility]], with Loruhn's daytime form visible almost due north, just behind the mountains over the [[Primal Caverns]].

Night 1 is the first night the player experiences on Drehmal, which will encompass the end of Day 1 and the beginning of Day 2 on the F3 menu. Therefore, Night 2 is understood to mean the transition between Day 2-3, and so on. Loruhn sits at an exact ordinal direction just before midnight on each day.

**Loruhn Cycle:**

- Night 1: Loruhn is visible to the north-northeast. <br>
- Night 2: Loruhn is visible to the northeast. <br>
- Night 3: Loruhn can be seen to the east-northeast. <br>
- Night 4: Loruhn is visible to the east. From about 19:30 to 20:10 on this night, Loruhn passes behind [[Lorahn]] as the latter moon rises, forming an eclipse. <br>
- Night 5: Loruhn rests to the east-southeast.
- Night 6: Loruhn is located directly between the rising Lorahn and [[LD|Lo'Dahr]] in the southeastern sky. <br>
- Night 7: Loruhn is found to the south-southeast, close to Lo'Dahr. <br>
- Night 8: Loruhn passes behind Lo'Dahr in the southern night sky, forming an eclipse for the entirety of the night. Total eclipse is achieved just before midnight. <br>![[ruhndahr_eclipse.png]] <br>
- Night 9: Loruhn completes moving behind Lo'Dahr, and sits in the south-southwestern sky. <br>
- Night 10: Loruhn is situated to the southwest, directly between Lo'Dahr and a setting Lorahn. <br>
- Night 11: Loruhn shines from the west-southwest. <br>
- Night 12: Loruhn sits to the west, evenly spacing out the three moons as Lorahn rises. There is a brief, partial eclipse as Lorahn sets, from about 04:00 to 04:30. <br>
- Night 13: Loruhn is found in the west-northwest. <br>
- Night 14: Loruhn sits in the northwestern sky. <br>
- Night 15: Loruhn approaches its original position, visible to the north-northwest. <br>
- Night 16: Loruhn sits due north in the night sky. The cycle repeats.

## Lore

Loruhn is best known to the people of Drehmal for its permanent auroras, visible from the disc at night, which have been the source of significant artistic inspiration. Loruhn was one of the three moons worshipped by the [[Tri-Moon Theocracy]], being referred to in the [[Ancient Sacrament]] as the "home of drakes". 

After the events of the [[Divine Schism]], which ended in [[Maen]], Aspect of Pain, murdering the Aspect of Storms, [[Palaesida]], Maen was permanently exiled from the Aspects' home on Lo'Dahr. Maen was shackled to Loruhn, where he remains to this day.
