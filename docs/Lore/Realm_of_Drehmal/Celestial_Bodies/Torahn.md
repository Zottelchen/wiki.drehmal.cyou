# Torahn

![[torahn.png]]{ align=right width="200" }

The **Torahn** is the sun of Drehmal's realm, functioning very similarly to a star. It provides light to the realm during the day, rising in the east and setting in the west, before continuing to revolve beneath the [[disc]] at night. It orbits the disc, directly opposite [[Lorahn]].

## Mechanics

Mechanically, the Torahn is identical to the vanilla Minecraft sun.

## Lore

While the Torahn may simply appear to be a normal star, the book [[Manifesto of the Sunchasers]] comes to a much more confusing conclusion. This book, written as a summary of a study by a [[Maelmari]] research group at the [[Burnt Palace]], comes to the bizarre observation that the Torahn is, in fact, a moon-sized pufferfish. This pufferfish inflates with gas during the day, swelling up to a massive size and emanating exorbitant amounts of light and energy, and slightly deflates at night. It also "recharges" to some degree at night.

This appears to be the canon explanation for the Torahn, and not a joke book.

The Torahn is prominently featured as a symbol on [[Avsohm]]'s banners.
