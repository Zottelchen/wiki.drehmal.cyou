# Lo'Veruhkt

**Lo'Veruhkt**, also known as the "moon out of sight" or the "Hidden Moon", is the fourth moon of Drehmal, located beneath the disc. Its existence was known on [[Overworld|Drehmal]] primarily by the people of [[Veruhkt Plateau]], who named themselves after it.

This moon cannot be seen in the night sky due to its location.

## Appearance

In [[Convictions of Tech-Priest Lakeivaa]], Lo'Veruhkt is described as a brilliant shade of purple, with shimmering specks of gold.

## Lore

In modern times (after the [[Felling]]), it appears that most academics and average Drehmari considered Lo'Veruhkt to be a total myth, as [[Moons of the Realm]] calls it "most likely a total fabrication". 

However, the people of [[Veruhkt Plateau]], who named themselves and their homeland after the moon, learned of it through a vision revealed to one of their first prophets, Poa. The early Veruhktians constructed the massive Lens of Insight at the [[Altar of Insight]] to peer through the [[disc]] itself, confirming the existence of the hidden moon. They grew obsessed with the idea of ascending to the disc, and eventually, when they were nearly wiped out by forces from [[Akhlo'Rohma]] and [[Avsohm]], the survivors sought ascension to Lo'Veruhkt as a means of escape from their oppression.

As nobody remains at the Altar of Insight today, it is unclear if they were successful or simply all died waiting for their salvation.

The hidden moon is also closely tied to [[Rihelma|Star-Rise Drake Rihelma]], the prophetic Aspect of Sky. While she lived nominally with the other [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) on [[LD|Lo'Dahr]], Rihelma was known to make frequent trips to the hidden moon, where she would commune with beings beyond the [[Veil]] and receive her many prophecies. Today, it is suggested that Rihelma resides permanently on Lo'Veruhkt.

Lo'Veruhkt can be seen in-game during and after the 75% completion event on the [[Aphelion]]. If the player is in the Space or Lo'Dahr dimensions, the moon can be seen toward the bottom of the skybox. It appears as a thin, purple crescent, visible at all times of day. It follows the same clockwise, 16-day orbital pattern as [[Loruhn]], but directly opposite that moon. Whereas Loruhn is in the north-northeastern sky on Day 1, Lo'Veruhkt starts out in the south-southwest.
