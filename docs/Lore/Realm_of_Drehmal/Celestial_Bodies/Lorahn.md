# Lorahn

**Lorahn** (pronounced "lor-on") is the closest moon to Drehmal, and consequently the largest in the night sky. It appears as a bright white rocky moon, very similar to Earth's real moon.

## Mechanics

Lorahn replaces the vanilla Minecraft moon, moving from east to west in the sky at night, directly opposite the [[Torahn]]. It does not change its appearance in any way, contrary to the lore around this moon.

## Lore

In the [[(REMOVED) Calendar of Drehmal|removed "Calendar of Drehmal" book]], it was written that months were determined by Lorahn's cycles, as every 25 days, Lorahn would change to a new color. There were 9 different phases in total, corresponding to the nine months of the Drehmari calendar. The removal of this book from the map does call into question the canonicity of this concept, but the idea of Lorahn changing colors does appear in other sources. This is not, however, represented in real map mechanics in the skybox.

Lorahn is the namesake of the [[Lorahn'Kahl]] region, whose early inhabitants were necromancers worshipping the three moons. Based on the explicit references to this moon in particular found within this region (the ruins of [[Sal'Lorahn]], the [[Artifacts#Lorahn Sacrificial Blade|Lorahn Sacrificial Blade]], and more), it seems that it may have been the most important of the three moons to the [[Tri-Moon Theocracy]]. The [[Ancient Sacrament]] refers to Lorahn as the "creator of time". This may be a reference to the fact that the calendar system was so heavily reliant on Lorahn.
