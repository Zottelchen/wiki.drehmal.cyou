**Lo'Dahr**, also known as the **Divine Moon**, is one of the moons of the realm of Drehmal, and the home of the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects). It appears to the south in the night sky, and does not move.

## Mechanics

Lo'Dahr follows a very simple mechanic, appearing only at night. It can be seen due south in the sky, at an altitude of 26.5 degrees above the horizon (the same altitude as [[Loruhn]]). Lo'Dahr does not move, and emanates a bright yellow aura around its main spherical body.

Lo'Dahr can eclipse Loruhn, lasting for the entirety of Night 8 of the Loruhn cycle.

## Lore

Named after Abyssal Elder [[Dahr]], the Sea Aspect who is considered the king of all the Aspects, Lo'Dahr was first made habitable by Dahr himself. It is said by [[Relics#Writ of Authority|his +3 relic]] that Dahr's mortal subjects once lived in a massive ocean he created on the moon, but the other Aspects shaped it into their living quarters, allowing him to remain the king in name. This likely occurred around the time of the [[Felling]], when most of the Aspects began to withdraw from [[Drehmari]] affairs.

Lo'Dahr was one of the three moons of Drehmal worshipped by the [[Tri-Moon Theocracy]], with the [[Ancient Sacrament]] calling it the "throne of the divine".

The [[Akhlo'Rohma#Sunken Astral Body|Sunken Astral Body]], located in the mountains east of [[Dusps]], is a massive crater believed to be a fallen fragment of Lo'Dahr. It appears notably alien, featuring lighter gravity, strange materials not seen elsewhere on Drehmal, and glass jellyfish. This site was very popular with certain religious groups and researchers following its discovery in mid-late Av2. Perhaps the most prominent was Project ArkAngel, an [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] [[Kiln of Virtuo#Divination Facility (Project ArkAngel)|project]] which attempted to research a material found at the impact site in a cave behind the [[Kiln of Virtuo]].

It is suggested by [[Prefect's Grumblings]] that the Aspects may still be alive on Lo'Dahr as evidenced by the presence of a colorful patch of the moon beneath the cloud layer. While there has been very little to no contact between the Aspects and the people of the [[disc]] in over a millennium, it does seem to be the case that Lo'Dahr is still home to the Aspects and possibly even more civilization.
