**Rihselch** (pronounced "rice-elch") is an ancient language in Drehmal, spoken by the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) and presumably by the people of the First Avihm. Many of the original names of individuals and places in Drehmal are of Rihselch origin, although it is not widely spoken except by scholars in the modern day.
