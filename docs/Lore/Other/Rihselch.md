--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Rihselch** is an ancient language in Drehmal, spoken by the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) and presumably by the people of the First Avihm. Much of the original names of individuals and places in Drehmal are thought to be Rihselch in origin, although it is not widely spoken except by scholars in the modern day.
