# Lore-Only Locations

Drehmal is a very large map, but it is outsized still by its expansive network of lore, developed for years before Drehmal v2 was created or even conceptualized. This page holds some of the locations which exist in Drehmal's lore, and may even be referenced in-game, but cannot actually be visited in the map.

## Primzahl

**Primzahl** was the central continent of the [[Disc]] in the First Avihm. Home to the [[Primal Tree]], it was destroyed in the [[Felling]], and reformed into much of modern Drehmal's central regions. It is not mentioned by this name in current versions of the map, but it has been spoken about by developers in the past.

## Xivrhynt

The continents of [[Xivrhynt]], Western and Eastern, are the broken, scarred remnants of the original far western and eastern continents from Av1, left at the far edges of the [[disc]].

These continents include many, many locations, such as the remains of the ancient Bright Capital, which do not appear in-map.

## Old Drabyel

Old Drabyel (simply referred to as "Drabyel") was the capital of the [[Chosen Kingdom]] when [[Drehn|Drehn Mal'Sohm]] took over and reformed it into the Empire of [[Avsohm]]. It was said to be a large metropolis, but extremely corrupt, prompting Drehn to leave it behind and construct a new capital, [[Av'Sal]]. There are no clear ruins that might be Old Drabyel, and it is not believed to be the case that [[Drabyel|New Drabyel]] is simply built over it.

## Sal'Tehrmis

Sal'Tehrmis was a planned city build in the northern Tehrmia/[[Purity Peaks]] region, near the Sunken Astral Body. It is referenced in the [[Project ArkAngel]] book, but cannot actually be found.

## Ihted

The original Ihted was a large city from the First Avihm, and a central hub of arcane knowledge, home to a massive academy where [[Khive]] taught the rules of magic to Drehmari. It has been lost to time, however, with [[Ihted|another ruin]] being retroactively given its name. [[Ihted Academy]] is a remnant of this city, but the rest of the ruin does not seem to be located anywhere within the map (not known by that name).
