The **Exodus Vault** was an [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] facility deep beneath the once-existent Lake Nimahj, and it serves as the setting for the 50% completion event. Situated along the border between [[Nimahj Swamp]] and [[Anyr'Nogur]], the entirely underground facility once served as the headquarters for [[Blue Exodus]], the group that effectively made up the bulk of Avsohm's military. The vault is connected to [[Exodus Citadel]], another Blue Exodus facility that was once underwater, on the lakebed's surface, and through which players must first progress in order to reach the vault. 

Within the vault, the player can find numerous advanced weapons and machines created by Blue Exodus for Avsohmic use, which appear to have been manufactured and/or stored at this location. The vault is home to two linked [legendary items](/Items/Legendary_Items/), as well as one half of the [[Mythbreaker]]'s blade.

    These coordinates correspond to the entrance to the vault.

## Story (50% Completion Event)
Upon reaching 50% network linkage (16 towers), the player will be prompted by [[avSYS]] to enter the [[Terminus Network|Terminus's]] compass dispensary, where they will be given a lodestone compass that points towards Exodus Citadel. At the Citadel, the player can re-link the facility's holotext database before falling down to the entrance to the vault, in the northern wing of the Citadel.

After solving the puzzle to gain entry to the vault, the floor on the opposite side of the room will give way, revealing a tunnel to the vault proper.

The player first emerges onto a glass walkway over a flooded lower level, with several advanced planes, trucks, tanks, and other vehicles visible lining the walls of the facility. On the upper level, the player can progress throughout the south wing of the vault, then eventually proceed to unlock the northern wing containing the Mythbreaker fragment. 

Holotexts in the vault elaborate upon some of the previous aspects of the story, such as hinting more at some kind of problems at [[Mt. Yavhlix]] and mentioning the Resonant Eye. The main story event at this location, however, is obtaining the right blade fragment of the Mythbreaker. After navigating through the partially flooded vault, the player is able to enter the Graviton Crucible, where the blade was originally forged, and claim the second and final piece of the spear.

The player can leave the facility at any point through the way they came, but it is intended for the player to exit by solving the puzzle regarding the large vault door (see below section for details).

## Gameplay
Access to the Vault is initially blocked by a large vault door in a room beneath the northern wing of Exodus Citadel, and the player must solve the puzzle nearby in order to enter the vault. In this room is one holotext (seen below), which depicts a pattern of blue squares and dashes.

??? question "Hint"
    The pattern on the holotext is spread out over an 8x7 block grid, a set of dimensions reflected elsewhere in the room, and with the same color scheme.

??? warning "Puzzle Solution"
    On the room's southern wall, there is an 8 block wide/7 block tall grid, which initially contains 21 cyan concrete blocks in an "E" pattern, forming the Blue Exodus logo. These 21 blocks can be mined and re-placed within the grid. If placed in the same pattern as the holotext shows, then the floor on the northern end will give way to a staircase down to the vault.

Following this puzzle, the player can proceed into the vault proper, where they are placed into Adventure Mode.

The main portion of the vault is accessed through the tower in the center of the glass walkway, turning to the left at the top (towards the southern wing). In the southern wing, the player must navigate through partially flooded rooms until coming to a room with the [[exodus_whining.md|Vortu's Complaint]] holotext and three levers. Flipping these three levers will restore power to the facility, at the cost of electrifying the water in certain rooms. This water, which visibly sparks and makes noise, deals damage to the player on contact, and must be avoided in order to progress.

After restoring power, the player can begin to open holo-doors in the facility, eventually coming to a higher bridge that connects to the northern wing of the vault. Here, the player must navigate through more heavily flooded rooms, as well as dealing with stronger laser-gun-wielding enemies. The northern wing also contains a chest with the three S-21 [[Artifacts|artifacts]], strong shields that were legendaries in the 2.1 version of Drehmal.

By finding their way through the pipes in the northern wing, the player can eventually make it to the Graviton Crucible, where the right blade fragment of the Mythbreaker can be found. 

From here, the player can return to the main tower in the center hallway and proceed to the garages to the west. In the garage on the left, the [[Warp Horse]] legendary items can be claimed, and on the right, the [[Trinkets#Tank Keyfob|Tank Key Fob]] is attainable. These two garages are blocked off by tinted glass initially, and are only accessible after power has been restored to the facility. 

As hinted at by the [[exodus_tank.md|Tank Technician's Troubles]] holotext, the keyfob can be used to fire the tank positioned just in front of the vault door, simply by pressing the button on the tank while the keyfob is nearby (in a player's inventory or in the shulker box on the tank). This tank shot (which WILL deal damage to players if in the way!) blows a hole in the vault door, allowing the player to exit the vault through a long passageway leading to another door, which opens out into the [[Anyr'Nogur]] desert.

## Original Writing
A total of [11 holotexts](/Story_and_Features/Holotexts/50_Percent_Area/) can be found at the Exodus Vault and Citadel.

In addition, there are 4 lore books found at this location: <br>
- [[Gokoh's Victory Lap]] contains the gloating of Gokoh, a Blue Exodus sergeant, whose colossal weapons have been approved for use aboard the Aphelion. <br>
- [[Kovis's Hypothesis]] is written by a [[Kovis|Blue Exodus staffer]], and contains a mix of known facts and speculation on an Avsohmic device known as the Resonant Eye, which becomes a pertinent part of the later story. <br>
- [[Musings of Kahmas]] is written by General [[Kahmas Tuhs]], and contains some of the general's second thoughts regarding Avsohmic expansion. <br>
- [[Water-Damaged Letter]] is written by an unnamed deliveryperson who worked between the vault and [[The Foundry]], detailing some of the increased military presence in and around the vault at the time of writing.

## Lore
The Exodus Vault was the headquarters of Blue Exodus during Avsohm's reign. It was considered among the most secure locations in the empire, containing a significant amount of Blue Exodus' machinery and personnel. While the Exodus Vault has always been entirely underground, it was even harder to find in Avsohm's era, as the Exodus Citadel outside of it used to be at the bottom of Lake Nimahj. Personnel who worked within the Citadel were not allowed to visit the vault unless given explicit permission.

The Vault was, at some point or another, worked in by many pertinent figures in Avsohmic history, including Blue Exodus leader [[Kahmas Tuhs]], researcher [[Kovis]], technicians Vortu, Ekoh, Naskiki, and others.

Kovis' work in particular is critical to understanding the history of the site, as she was the primary mind behind the Graviton Crucible. The Graviton Crucible, located within the northern wing of the vault, is an extremely intricate machine, capable of forging highly powerful materials. When the form of the Mythbreaker was revealed to Avsohm through the Resonant Eye, [[Thresa Vera|CSO Thresa]] brought the data to Kovis, who was able to devise schematics to forge the spear's blade using the Crucible. The Inert Mythbreaker was first created in the vault, and shortly thereafter, it was split into two separate pieces. These fragments were spread between [[Sal'Mevir]] and the Graviton Crucible in Exodus Vault, to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands before the weapon would supposedly be reunited, charged and used by [[Anyr|Emperor Anyr]].

Many of the workers present at the vault during [[Fall of Avsohm|Avsohm's sudden fall]] appear to have been corrupted, becoming the humanoid enemies found by the player, including Lost Technician Naskiki, the technician responsible for the [[Warp Horse]] prototype.
