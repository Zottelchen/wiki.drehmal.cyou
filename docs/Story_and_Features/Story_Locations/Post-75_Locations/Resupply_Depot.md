The **Resupply Depot** is one of five main story locations on the divine moon of [[Lo'Dahr]], located in the southeast of the moon's habitable area, in [[Rihelma's Domain]]. The facility is found on a floating island in the far east of the northern sub-region of Rihelma's Domain, over 100 blocks above ground level. It was the first [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] facility built on Lo'Dahr, and served as a transportation and logistics hub in the empire's efforts to colonize the moon.

Like the other two non-core facilities on Lo'Dahr, its primary purpose in the map is to teach the player a mechanic that can be applied to the main puzzle at the [[Core Facility]].

    | **X** | **Y** | **Z** |
    |:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|

    Within the Lo'Dahr dimension, these coordinates place the player at the surface of the Resupply Depot, atop the floating island.

## Story
After reaching the Core Facility, the player will likely find the map depicting the four main Avsohmic facilities on Lo'Dahr, one of which is the Resupply Depot. There is no correct or intended order to visit the other three facilities, as long as the player eventually learns the lessons from each one.

The Depot is found floating high in the air, alongside numerous other floating islands in the northern portion of Rihelma's Domain. The player must find their own way up to the island, at which point they can explore the facility.

Holotexts at the facility provide insight towards the beginning of Avsohm's lunar expeditions, including first-hand accounts of the initial landings, the building of this facility as a logistical base for the project, and the dynamics between the facilities.

The player can eventually find a holotext in the center of a room, between two display screens on either wall. This holotext hints at the main puzzle mechanic in this location.

## Gameplay
Getting up to the Resupply Depot alone can be difficult, as the facility is 100 blocks above ground level, in an area with custom Phoenix enemies (flaming, undying phantoms). Players may try to use primal pearls, water, or other means to access the facility, as well as climbing up other islands and gliding to the facility.

At the facility, the main puzzle revolves around the transfer of energy from the [[Aphelion]]. The Aphelion is in orbit around Lo'Dahr (alongside the [[Terminus Network|Terminus]], and as such, is at a different point in the sky at any given moment. A [holotext](depot_transfer.md) provides a very strong hint toward the solution to this puzzle.

??? question "Hint: Resupply Depot Energy Transfer"
    The holotext states that sometimes, energy transfer must be recalibrated, which can only be done when the Terminus and Aphelion are directly overhead, roughly once every 75 seconds. <br>

??? warning "Puzzle Solution"
    The player can realign this station by waiting up to 75 seconds for the screen on the left to flicker, indicating that the stations are aligned. At this moment, the player must hit the button on the right, which will begin an energy transfer, destroying a portion of the structure in front of the holotext and revealing two pieces of celestial debris.

Completing this puzzle grants the player the "Energy Technician" [[Advancements|advancement]], and indicates functional completion of the location's goal.

## Original Writing
There are [6 holotexts](/Story_and_Features/Holotexts/Post-75_Areas/Resupply_Depot/) to be found at the Resupply Depot.

There is also one lore book, [[Masin's Complaint]], which mirrors the book found in the [[Inscription Complex]].

## Lore
The Resupply Depot was the first Avsohmic facility built on the moon of Lo'Dahr, as it is very close to the site of Avsohm's first moon landing. As such, several prominent Avsohmic figures are known to have spent time here, most notably Verpyne and [[Devro Ihb]]. 

The construction of the facility was directly ordered by [[Anyr|Emperor Anyr]] after Avsohm's first landings on the moon's surface. It served as a spaceport during its tenure, taking incoming shipments (including energy) from the Aphelion and dispersing them throughout Avsohm's holdings on the moon, and vice versa.
