The **Numencore** is the fifth and final main story location on the divine moon of [[Lo'Dahr]]. The Numencore is accessed by solving the main puzzle at the [[Core Facility]], using information from the other three locations on the moon's surface. 

The Numencore is a massive concentration of [[Primal Energy|primal energy]] utilized by [[Khive]], the [Aspect](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) of Magic, as his source of power, and by extension, the source of primal energy for all of the Aspects. The core was accessed by [[Avsohm]] in the later years of its reign, and the player's time at the Numencore is spent in the facility they built to attempt to harness its power.

    Within the Lo'Dahr dimension, these coordinates place the player in the Numencore, just in front of the warp ring.

## Story (Arrival)
After solving the [[Core Facility#Gameplay|Core Facility puzzle]], the player is directly transported to the Numencore, gaining the "Apex of Divinity" [[Advancements|advancement]].

Within, the player can read holotexts that paint a clearer picture of Avsohm's truest ambitions on Lo'Dahr and beyond. 

It is made clear that Avsohm intended to use the Numencore as a secondary source of primal energy to charge the [[Mythbreaker]] with, as using the network on [[Overworld|Drehmal]] would crash the power grid entirely due to the amount of energy the spear would require. At this point, Avsohm intended to use the Mythbreaker to tear a physical hole in the [[Veil]], allowing them to venture beyond the boundaries of their own realm. A station was constructed to charge the Mythbreaker using the Numencore, and the plan had the full backing of [[Anyr|Emperor Anyr]].

However, this plan was put on indefinite hold after Marto, an Avsohmic researcher on the site, convinced those in charge that it was not worth potentially incurring the wrath of Khive by stealing a significant amount of energy from their own power source, and the project was shelved. Avsohm [[Fall of Avsohm|fell]] before the plan was ever carried out.

The player, however, does have the power to enact this plan, and in order to progress the story, must do so.

## Gameplay
The Numencore can only be accessed through the warp ring at the Core Facility, and it can be left via that same warp ring at any time. 

Its primary gameplay concerns the charging of the Mythbreaker, and the following sequence with the Charged Mythbreaker.

In order to access the charging station, the player must flip two override switches, one on either side of the facility, and then place the Inert Mythbreaker on the opened charging station.

Doing so and exiting the facility begins the [[Story Progression#Mythbreaker Run (LATE-GAME SPOILERS BEGIN HERE)|Mythbreaker run]]. 

## Original Writing
Within the Numencore, there are [5 holotexts](/Story_and_Features/Holotexts/Post-75_Areas/Core/) to be found.

There is also [one book](Researcher_Cehva's_Side_Project.md) at the Numencore, which contains deeper information on [[Orix Cehein]].

## Lore
The Numencore was created as Khive's primary reserve of primal energy, and its purpose was to serve as a source of primal energy for them and the other Aspects. Khive, being the Aspect of Magic, has innate control over primal energy, but does not have the ability to apply it in the unique ways that other Aspects do in their own domains of nature. As such, Khive facilitated the work of the other Aspects by creating pathways for them to draw upon the Numencore's energy.

The Numencore likely went physically untouched until Avsohm's colonization of the moon in the late Second Avihm, at which point they utilized their [[Ring Facility#Lore|reverse-engineered warp rings]] to establish a physical gateway to the Numencore. Avsohm built a small facility around the core, with the ultimate goal of harnessing it as an energy source to charge the Mythbreaker with.

Several prominent Avsohmic characters are known to have spent time at the Numencore facility, including [[Kahmas Tuhs]], Ekoh, Cehva, and Marto.

## Extras

### Trivia

Boundary-breaking in the Numencore can reveal two easter eggs.

??? danger "Forbidden Knowledge!"
    Directly underneath the facility, obtainable only by using cheats to enter Creative or Spectator Mode, the player can obtain the **Meethbreekr**, a joke rendition of the Mythbreaker. The Meethbreekr is a golden shovel enchanted with Level 255 Sharpness, dealing a patently absurd 130.5 damage per hit. <br>
    Deep inside the core itself, a player head resembling a plush figure of Maelihs can be found.

### Soundtrack

The song that plays when entering the Numencore for the first time is simply titled "The Core", by Drehmal composer Chris Nesja.
