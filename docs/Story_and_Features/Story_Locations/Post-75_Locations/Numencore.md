The **Numencore** is the fifth and final main story location on the divine moon of [[Lo'Dahr]]. The Numencore is accessed by solving the main puzzle at the [[Core Facility]], using information from the other three locations on the moon's surface. 

The Numencore is a massive concentration of [[Primal Energy]] utilized by [[Khive]], the Aspect of Magic, as his source of power, and by extension, the source of primal energy for all of the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/). The core was accessed by Avsohm in the later years of their reign, and the player's time at the Numencore is spent in the facility they built to attempt to harness its power.

    Within the Lo'Dahr dimension, these coordinates place the player in the Numencore, just in front of the warp ring.

## Story (Arrival)
After solving the [[Core Facility#Gameplay|Core Facility puzzle]], the player is directly transported to the Numencore, gaining the "Apex of Divinity" advancement.

Within, the player can read holotexts that paint a clearer picture of Avsohm's truest ambitions on Lo'Dahr and beyond. 

It is made clear that Avsohm intended to use the Numencore as a secondary source of Primal Energy to charge the [[Mythbreaker]] with, as using the network on Drehmal would crash the power grid entirely due to the amount of energy the spear would require. At this point, Avsohm intended to use the Mythbreaker to tear a physical hole in the Veil, allowing them to peer beyond the boundaries of their own realm. A station was constructed to charge the Mythbreaker using the Numencore, and the plan had the full backing of Emperor [[Anyr]].

However, this plan was put on indefinite hold after [[Marto]], an Avsohmic researcher on the site, convinced the empire that it was not worth potentially incurring the wrath of [[Khive]] by stealing a significant amount of energy from his power source, and the project was shelved. Avsohm fell before the plan was ever carried out.

The player, however, does have the power to enact this plan, and in order to progress the story, must do so.

## Gameplay
The Numencore can only be accessed through the warp ring at the [[Core Facility]], and it can be left via that same warp ring at any time. 

Its primary gameplay concerns the charging of the Mythbreaker, and the following sequence with the Charged Mythbreaker.

In order to access the charging station, the player must flip two override switches, one on either side of the facility, and then place the Inert Mythbreaker on the opened charging station.

Doing so and exiting the facility begins the [[Story Progression#Mythbreaker Run (LATE-GAME SPOILERS BEGIN HERE)|Mythbreaker Run]]. 

## Original Writing
Within the Numencore, there are [5 holotexts](/Story_and_Features/Holotexts/Post-75_Areas/Core/) to be found.

There is also [one book](Researcher_Cehva's_Side_Project.md) at the Numencore, which contains deeper information on [[Orix Cehein]].

## Lore
The Numencore was created as [[Khive]]'s primary reserve of [[Primal Energy]], and its initial purpose was to serve as a source of Primal Energy for the other Aspects. Khive, being the Aspect of Magic, has innate control over Primal Energy, but does not have the ability to apply it in the unique ways that other Aspects do. As such, Khive facilitated the work of the other Aspects by creating pathways for them to draw upon the Numencore's energy.

The Numencore likely went physically untouched until Avsohm's colonization of the moon in the late second Avihm, at which point they utilized their [[Ring Facility#Lore|reverse-engineered warp rings]] to establish a physical gateway to the Numencore. Avsohm built a small facility around the core, with the ultimate goal of harnessing it as an energy source to charge the Mythbreaker with.

Several prominent Avsohmic characters are known to have spent time at the Numencore facility, including [[Kahmas Tuhs]], [[Ekoh]], [[Cehva]], and [[Marto]].

## Extras
Boundary-breaking in the Numencore can reveal two easter eggs.

??? danger "Forbidden Knowledge!"
    Directly underneath the facility, obtainable only by using cheats to enter Creative or Spectator Mode, the player can obtain the **Meethbreekr**, a joke rendition of the Mythbreaker. The Meethbreekr is a golden shovel enchanted with Level 255 Sharpness, dealing a patently absurd 130.5 damage per hit. <br>
    Deep inside the core itself, a player head resembling a plush figure of Maelihs can be found.
