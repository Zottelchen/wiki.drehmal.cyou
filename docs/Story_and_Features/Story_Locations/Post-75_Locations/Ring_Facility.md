The **Warp Ring Research Installation**, also known as the **Ring Research Installation**, **Warp Ring Installation**, or simply the **Ring Facility**, is one of five main story locations on the divine moon of [[Lo'Dahr]]. It is located in the western portion of the moon, inside of Lake Khanak, part of the southern half of [[Khive's Domain]].

Like the other two non-core facilities on Lo'Dahr, its primary purpose in the map is to teach the player a mechanic that can be applied to the main puzzle at the [[Core Facility]]. 

??? abstract "Coordinates"
    | **X** | **Y** | **Z** |
    |:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
    | -918  |  73   | -216  |

    Within the Lo'Dahr dimension, these coordinates place the player at the top of the Ring Research Installation, at the lake's surface.

## Story
After reaching the Core Facility, the player will likely find the map depicting the four main Avsohmic facilities on Lo'Dahr, one of which is the Ring Installation. There is no correct or intended order to visit the other three facilities, as long as the player eventually learns the lessons from each one.

The Ring Installation is found in the middle of a lake in Khive's Domain. Its holotexts are the most isolated in scope of the main Lo'Dahr facilities, primarily focusing on the efforts at this location alone. These holotexts provide insight into Avsohm's harnessing of warp [Arcanism|runes]], gradually reverse-engineering a full teleportation network out of the warp rings.

The main puzzle of the facility is simply figuring out how to use the warp rings, as the answer is not presented plainly until the player has traveled through a certain ring in the facility.

## Gameplay
The majority of the facility lies underneath the lake, and can either be accessed through the warp ring at the surface or through the large hole in the center of the pit at the surface.

Inside the facility, two warp rings are accessible. One links to the ring at the surface of the lake, and the other, on the bottom level of the facility, connects to an isolated room separate from the rest of the research installation. Successfully using either one will grant the [[Advancements|advancement]] for solving the puzzle, but the latter leads to a room with holotexts that state the method of use outright.

There are multiple holotexts that hint at the solution to the ring puzzle in the facility, informing the player that active rings glow blue on their sides, and that the rings must not be observed in order to function properly.

??? warning "Puzzle Solution"
    The warp rings can only be used by the player if they do not see the ring. Simply walking backwards through an active ring is sufficient to teleport through it. Doing so will grant the "Backwards Thinking" advancement.

Solving this puzzle will effectively complete the location's goal.

## Original Writing
The Ring Installation boasts the largest holotext count of the Lo'Dahr facilities, at [8 holotexts](/Story_and_Features/Holotexts/Post-75_Areas/Ring_Facility/).

There is also one unique lore book to be found within the facility: [[Vehmil's Reflections]], which provides an account from [Stasis Eight](/Lore/Historical_Figures/Avsohm/Stasis_Eight/) member [[Baen Vehmil]].

## Lore
In Avsohm's initial expansion onto Lo'Dahr, prior to the advent of the [[Terminus Network|Terminus]], the empire found themselves without a reliable source of energy for their lunar endeavors. Therefore, one of the highest priorities was to secure a source of energy on the moon, and the Ring Facility was built, initially being a hydroelectric power plant in Lake Khanak. 
However, the discovery and harnessing of the [[Numencore]] meant for a more efficient local source of all the energy needed on Lo'Dahr, making the power plant obsolete. As such, it was recommissioned into a facility to research the warp rings found throughout Khive's Domain.

Study of the rings led to Avsohm reverse-engineering warp technology of their own by copying the runes found on the rings, and over time, improvements were steadily made to the system, to the point that the non-observation principle could be worked around. This led to Vortu's invention of the Avsohmic warp towers now found throughout the map, and the Terminus through which they are all interconnected.

The Ring Installation was home to some recurring characters who appear primarily at this location, such as Arli and Symis, as well as Baen Vehmil.
