The **Core Facility** is one of five main story locations on the divine moon of [[Lo'Dahr]], and the closest to the player's initial starting point on the moon. It can be found in the west of [[Taihgel's Domain]], just east of the city of [[Naharja]]. The facility primarily serves as a link to another location in Lo'Dahr, and as a hub for exploration of the moon, containing information on the other three main [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] facilities present there.

    Within the Lo'Dahr dimension, these coordinates place the player in front of the map of the four Avsohmic facilities on the moon at the Core Facility.

## Story (Arrival)
Upon arriving on Lo'Dahr, the player does not necessarily receive any information on where to go next, but the closest story location to the [[Terminus Network|Terminus]] warp tower's landing spot in [[Moen's Domain]] is the Core Facility, to the east in Taihgel's Domain. Aboard the [[Aphelion]], a chest can also be found, containing a lodestone compass that points towards the Core Facility when on the moon, making this the intended method of progression.

There is not much to be found initially in the facility, besides a map of the moon's habitable area, highlighting four different locations: The Core Facility itself in the east, the [[Resupply Depot]] in the southeast, the [[Inscription Complex]] in the far southwest, and the [[Ring Facility|Ring Research Installation]] in the west.

Another room immediately accessible contains three different holotext spots, which will come to hold copies of the [[Av'Sal Repository|Repository]] entries for the other three Lo'Dahr facilities as they are explored. This room also has a chest, containing a "Primal Energy Radar," which points to an unknown location on [[Overworld|Drehmal]] (it does not function on Lo'Dahr). This item can optionally be used in a later story sequence.

In the center of the facility lies a familiar 3x3 orange stained glass platform, identical to the one found at the entrance to the [[Admin Wing|Repository's admin wing]]. If this checkpoint is passed, a stairway will open downward to an additional area, where the true puzzle of the facility lies.

It is not readily apparent what, if anything, can be done in this room, which is intentional. From here, the player is driven to explore the rest of the moon, especially the other three locations, which each primarily exist to teach the player a key mechanic that can be applied in this room.

## Gameplay
Upon arriving at the Core Facility, players may immediately notice the security checkpoint. The solution to passing through this is the same as it was at the Repository Admin Wing:

??? warning "Checkpoint Solution"
    Removing all armor and standing still on the platform for about 10-15 seconds will open the passageway down to the interior room.

In the interior room, as previously mentioned, the player is not intended to know what to do on first arrival. It is HIGHLY recommended that you figure out this puzzle for yourself, as exploring Lo'Dahr is one of the most rewarding parts of the map, and the mechanics should become clear once you have completed the puzzles at the other three locations.

If you have completed all of these puzzles and are still uncertain what to do, the following hints and solution may be helpful.

??? question "Hint: Inscription Complex Lesson"
    The Inscription Complex's main puzzle revolves around how [[Arcanism|runic]] machinery is powered. Nearly everything in Avsohm operates on some form of runic technology, and this includes the Core Facility's mechanisms, one of which shares a key design element with the Inscription Complex.

??? question "Hint: Resupply Depot Lesson"
    The Resupply Depot was the hub for Avsohmic transport to and on Lo'Dahr, and as such, the site received energy transmissions to be used across the moon. This was achieved by beaming energy directly from the orbiting Aphelion, although this is still most efficient at close range.

??? question "Hint: Ring Installation Lesson"
    The Ring Research Installation was built to study [[Khive|Khive's]] warp rings, and it primarily exists to teach the player how to use these warp rings when active. Rings do still need power to be activated, though...

If you have completed all of these puzzles on your own and still don't know what to do, here's the solution:

??? danger "Core Facility Puzzle Solution"
    The Inscription Complex lesson must be applied first, as the player is required to place a diamond block on the flarepod (shroomlight) block between end rods, which activates the warp ring system's power. At this point, the warp ring is partially active, but not powered enough to be functional at all times. The ring is only functional when the "Station Aligned" screen flashes a sea lantern and plays a ringing sound effect, indicating that the Terminus is directly overhead and capable of beaming down enough [[Primal Energy|primal energy]] to use the ring.

After the player has solved this puzzle and gone through the warp ring, they are transported to the [[Numencore]], the fifth and final main story location on Lo'Dahr.

## Original Writing
The Core Facility itself contains only [[final_core_outside.md|one original holotext]], which is technically grouped with the Numencore holotexts. However, it is also home to copies of the three Repository entries for the other Avsohmic facilities on the moonâ€”the [[repo_inscription.md|Inscription Complex]], [[repo_depot.md|Resupply Depot]], and [[repo_ring.md|Ring Research Installation]].

There are no lore books in the Core Facility.

## Lore

!!! danger "The Lore section of this article discusses lore found throughout the rest of Lo'Dahr, beyond the initial Core Facility visit."

!!! danger "It is recommended that you do not continue reading this section unless you have thoroughly explored the other three facilities on the moon and accessed the Numencore."

!!! danger "![Spoiler Door](/assets/img/spoiler_door.png)"

The Core Facility was built primarily for one purpose: the establishment of a base at the Numencore. Early in the process of exploring space on the Aphelion, Avsohm discovered that there was a massive source of primal energy that they could potentially harness deep within the core of [[LD|Lo'Dahr]], but had no practical means of reaching it. Over time, they managed to reverse-engineer not only the runes on Khive's warp rings, allowing them to harness warp magic themselves in even more efficient manners, but they were able to create remote warp rings, which sent a package containing its own linked ring to a target destination, where it would unpack and create a link to the origin. The warp ring in the Core Facility is the origin, and its linked ring in the Numencore was the method through which Avsohm was able to access the latter location.
