# Av'Sal Repository

The **Av'Sal Repository** is a central location in the story of Drehmal: Apotheosis, located beneath the ruins of the [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] capitol building on the central island of [[Av'Sal]]. This area features a large hall with holotexts describing each of the main Avsohmic story locations, which are updated as the player finds and explores these areas.

There are 12 total repository entries, ranging from the [[Stasis Facility|very beginning]] of the story to the [[Resonant Halls|final Avsohmic story location]]. The holotexts each provide a brief overview of the pertinent information learned at that location, appearing vague until all information is found (all holotexts at that site are read). For a full list of the holotexts at the Repository, see [Repository Entries](/Story_and_Features/Holotexts/Av'Sal_Repository/Repository_Entries/).

The Repository is also home to the hilt of the [[Mythbreaker]], Avsohm's greatest weapon, as well as the contraption that can be used to reassemble the weapon in its inert form. Once the other two fragments of the blade have been obtained, they can be reunited to form the full weapon in this location.

    These coordinates place the player just outside the Repository, directly in front of the holodoor.

## Story
The player can access the repository at any time after reaching Av'Sal, often one of the first stops after exiting the Stasis Facility. Besides assembling the Mythbreaker, it does not itself host any story events at this point, primarily acting as a hub for information and to provide hints to the player when connecting concepts in the later game.

Upon obtaining the two Mythbreaker blade fragments at the [[Sal'Mevir|25%]] and [[Exodus Vault|50%]] story completion events, the player can reconnect them to the hilt at the Repository and claim the [[Mythbreaker#Inert Mythbreaker|Inert Mythbreaker]].

Another section of the Repository is unlocked as [[Admin Wing|part of the 75% completion event]], and can be accessed from the main hall of the Repository after this event.

## Gameplay
Entry to the Repository is blocked initially by a holo-door, nearly identical to the one found in the Stasis Facility. The same method to open that door works here as well. The Repository is accessed, like many Avsohmic structures, through elevators that utilize slow falling and levitation effects. 

The player is automatically placed into Adventure Mode when entering the Av'Sal Repository. 

The Mythbreaker, whose hilt is found floating in a small chamber at the back of the repository, cannot be accessed upon initially discovering the repository. When the player finds each blade fragment, they can re-attach it to the hilt by throwing it onto the platform in front of the hilt, which will trigger an animation that shows the spear being reassembled.

## Original Writing
There are a total of [29 holotexts](/Story_and_Features/Holotexts/Av'Sal_Repository/) that appear in the Repository proper (not including the [[Admin Wing|admin wing]]). The actual Repository entries account for 24 of these, with each location having one complete version and one incomplete version. Another 5 holotexts that are not included in the Repository entries are found within its bounds as well.

There are no lore books in the Repository proper.

## Lore
The origins of the Repository are not entirely clear, but it is known that it was considered a highly secure archive of information, hence why the Mythbreaker's hilt was intentionally stored there.
