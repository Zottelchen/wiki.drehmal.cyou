# Sal'Mevir

![[Salmevir.webp]]{ align=right width="300" }

**Sal'Mevir**, also known as the **Ancillary Research Facility**, was an Avsohmic research station in the [[Purity Peaks]] Region. Most of the facility is able to be explored if one finds it prior to the player's presence being requested by [[avSYS]], but the highest room with [[Items#Avsohm'Kohl]] is locked until one links 25% of the towers of [[The Terminus]]. At this level of linkage, avSYS will request the player's presence at Sal'Mevir and issue one coordinates leading there. The facility has many detailing scientists experiments with primal energy.

## Lore

The story of Sal'Mevir is relayed by the books it contains. These records outline the role Sal'Mevir played in the history of [[Mt. Yavhlix]].

### A brief timeline

- Sal'Mevir is founded sometime in Av2 around the year 1500 - 1600.
- A false alarm of a powerful energy source is detected and brushed off around Av2 1540, the origin of which likely being [[Mt. Yavhlix]].
- In Av2 1621 the Avsohmic Scientists create the first survey drones, constructed of pure rehntite, which are later used for scouting purposes.
- In Av2 1631, a sample from a mining crew operating near [[Mt. Yavhlix]] is found to disprove the false alarm from around Av2 1540, showing the presence of a strong source of energy. Survey drones are immediately dispatched to investigate.
- Upon further inspection and experimentation, in Av2 1632 the energy obtained a year before is proven to be exceptional, pushing the limits of what rehntite can do using the new power source. The true source of the mysterious energy is further beneath the mountain, and further investigation is sparked.
- A new weapon using the new power source, now called _Primal Energy_ is constructed in Av2 1640. The weapon being a powered railgun, which has insane range, with enough raw destructive force to level entire cities.
- In Av2 1647, the Frostfang Catastrophe occurs due to the skirmishing between the Frostfang Tribes of [[Faehrcyle]], this causes a continental shift in climate, turning [[Faehrcyle]] into an uninhabitable snowy wasteland, and also altering the climates of the [[Gulf of Drehmal]], [[Casai]], and [[Merijool]] . This creates an opportunity for the Avsohmic Empire to have full access to [[Mt. Yavhlix]], due to their advanced technology to withstand the climate, while the Frostfang Tribes migrate away to more livable lands.
- In Av2 1675, the Avsohmic High Court makes leaking information about the operation in [[Mt. Yavhlix]] punishable by eternal imprisonment in Temporal Stasis. This is despite the fact that it is well known that the operation in [[Mt. Yavhlix]] is happening and its where the energy is coming from. Around this time rumors start to spread about people within going insane.
- In Av2 1690, the Avsohmic Emperor halts the construction and mining operation in [[Faehrcyle]] and [[Mt. Yavhlix]].
- In Av2 1695, Emperor Ifeihl resumes the operation in [[Mt. Yavhlix]], in search for more Primal Energy to use in weapons to go to war with Maelhis.
