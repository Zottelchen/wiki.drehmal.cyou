The **True End** is the name for the final location in the main story of Drehmal: Apotheosis. It is accessed directly after the [[Maddened Path]].

## Story
![[true_end_realmbinder.png]]

After defeating the [[Emissary of the Void]], the player is given one final portal to step through, transporting them back to the Stasis Facility. However, the player will notice that the facility is different—quieter, grayer, and worn-down. As they progress toward the surface just as they did at the beginning of the map, the player will notice sand that has leaked in from the surface, and see that much of the facility appears to have decayed.

Climbing to the surface, the player finds the landscape completely covered in a vast sand dune, with only the three hills above the [[Primal Caverns]] remaining as a clear landmark. A trail of orderflame lanterns leads into the caverns, and this trail leads out the back of the hill.

Emerging from Drehmal's resting place, the player reaches the Final Grave, coming across the miles-long skeleton of the creator deity themself, staring up at the sky. The [end credits](endcredits_transcription.md) play out.

After the credits have ended and the player has sat with the corpse of their creator for a few minutes, the Mythoclast speaks one more time, telling the player of the ultimate fate of the realm. 

[[Virtuo]] met her demise at the edge of the realm, in [[Eastern Xivrhynt]], succumbing to "decay," likely the Nothing.

[[Maelihs]] was never able to overcome his pride and leave Lo'Dahr, and was among the last to die there, watching the world crumble away before he had righted any of his wrongs.

The [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) refused to settle their differences, dying as a family divided.

[[Drehmal]] finally awoke and emerged from the caverns, only to find the world they had created was almost entirely dead—dead except for them. However, at the very same time, the player, experiencing time much differently while in the Nothing, was still alive: the last of their [[Drehmari]], alive and fighting at the end of time, and with this, the creator deity felt peace in their final moments.

The Mythoclast then offers the player closure, asking if they are ready to move on. If the player selects "Yes," then they will be killed and taken away to the end credits room. If they select "Not Yet," then they may wander the dunes for as long as they like, before returning to Drehmal's skeleton and moving on. Either way, the player is the final being alive in the realm of Drehmal, and is offered closure.

## Gameplay
The player remains in Adventure Mode in the True End. There are no enemies to be found here.

The area which the player can actually explore is primarily restrained to the [[Capital Valley]] region, centered around the Primal Caverns. The True End is an entirely separate dimension from the Drehmal overworld, which contains only this area, the future version of [[Sal'Mevir]] accessed during the Temporal Engine puzzle, and the [[Maddened Path]] (located far away from the other two areas).

After The Mythoclast offers closure, if the player refuses, then they can trigger this dialogue option again by stepping on the yellow pillar of light near the skeleton. Alternatively, using the command `/trigger finality` will select the "Yes" option and transport the player to the end credits room.

## Lore
The True End is foreshadowed by the [[The Facets#Facet III|Third Facet]], which directly parallels the end of Drehmal. This has led to significant speculation by the community, attempting to discern the forces behind the death of the realm, and why it took place when it did. Some signs point toward this being an indication that there is a tie between [[Verrhys]], the Aspect of Silence, and the ending of Drehmal, perhaps suggesting ties between Verrhys and [[yellow|The Mythoclast]]. However, these ties are not concrete, as there is so little information on the Aspect.

The True End appears to have been inevitable, as suggested by the fact that warping into the future via the Temporal Engine at Sal'Mevir projects the player into this very dimension, in a version of Sal'Mevir covered in a vast dune.
