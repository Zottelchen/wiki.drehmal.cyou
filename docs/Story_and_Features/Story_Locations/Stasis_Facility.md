# Stasis Facility

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

The Stasis Facility is the first major story location in Drehmal, located in [[Capital Valley]] just south of the [[Primal Caverns]]. When a playthrough is begun by toggling the "Initialize" button in the settings room, any players will be transported to this facility, in one of eight temporal stasis pods. 

Within the story of the map, the Stasis Facility is a site where high-ranking [[Empire of Avsohm|Avsohmic]] officials were to be frozen in time in the event of an empire-wide catastrophe, released a few years later in order to rebuild the empire. The player assumes the identity of one of [[Stasis Eight|the eight officers on the bottom floor]], who are the only known survivors of the empire's collapse, after an unknown amount of time has passed.
