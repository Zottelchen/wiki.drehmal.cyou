> Adventuring Merchant in New Drabyel

Adventuring Merchants are special merchants, one of which can be found in each [official town/city](/World/Drehmal/Official_Towns/). An Adventuring Merchant's stall or building is marked by red and orange wool awning. Each of them sells a map of the town's region, a map of [[Overworld|Drehmal]] that displays all official towns on the mainland, a bundle, a relic vessel, and another special item that is unique to the merchant, and usually is associated with their area.

## Lore

Adventuring Merchants stand under the protection of [[Green Serpent]].

## Map of Drehmal

Every Adventuring Merchant on Drehmal sells a Map of Drehmal, which depicts the shape of the continent and the relative locations of towns on it, as well as the positions of the four visible celestial bodies in the sky.

**Description:**

**Map of [[Lo'Dahr]]:**

The Map of Lo'Dahr is sold by Adventuring Merchant Eliana in place of a regional map.

## Extras

Normally, Adventuring Merchants are immune to any sort of damage and cannot be turned into zombie villagers, but they can be killed by a player in Creative Mode or turned into a witch by a lightning strike. In this event, special merchant villagers can be re-summoned by using commands.

See [[FAQ#Can Custom Villagers Be Respawned?|this FAQ section]] for a full list of these commands.
