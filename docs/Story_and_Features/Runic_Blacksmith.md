# Runic Blacksmiths

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Runic Blacksmiths** are unique, named villagers found throughout the world of Drehmal, who sell [[Artisan Items]]. 

Runic Blacksmiths are found in every [major town](/World/Drehmal/Settlements/Official_Towns/), as well as in some isolated locations. Almost all Runic Blacksmiths' locations are denoted by a striped blue/light blue wool pattern, whether in a tent, merchant stall, or other building.

Runic Blacksmiths sometimes also offer other items, such as armor trims and Runic Amplifiers.
