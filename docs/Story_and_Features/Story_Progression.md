# Story Progression

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

The map of Drehmal adds its own main story to the game, which the player can take part in and ultimately complete. The storyline is non-linear, meaning the player is free to roam as they please and can move at their own pace and engage in story events as they wish. Throughout most of the story, the player is primarily given directions by [[avSYS]] via chat.

The following sections provide an overview of the story's progression.

## Stasis Facility

## Terminus
