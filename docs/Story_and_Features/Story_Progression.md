# Story Progression

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

In addition to its gameplay features and massive open world, Drehmal: Primordial adds a rich, original story spread across several different locations throughout the realm, slowly revealing more to the player about their origin, the fate of [[Empire of Avsohm|the powerful ancient empire]] that they came from, and the forces that govern the realm's existence.

The story is most frequently divided into sections based on the player's network linkage percent, which is increased by finding, climbing, and linking [[Terminus Network#Towers|Avsohmic warp towers]] found throughout the continent, linking exploration to story progression. After reaching 25%, 50%, and 75% completion (8, 16, and 24 towers linked, respectively), the player will be prompted by [[avSYS]] to visit a pertinent location in the world, giving them a compass leading to that location in the Terminus' compass dispensary. The sequences which take place at these locations, mostly locked behind their respective completion percentages, are known as the 25%, 50%, and 75% completion events. Several spoiler warnings on this wiki, and in other discussions around this map, rely on these milestones. After completing the (spoiler-heavy) 75% event, the player can initiate an end-game sequence and does not necessarily have to link any more towers to finish the story.

The following sections provide an overview of the story's progression, in (approximate) chronological order. Distinct spoiler warnings are given for each section where applicable. 

!!! note "If you have not completed the map yourself, do NOT navigate to later headings using the outline feature! Spoiler warnings appear throughout this page before the *first* instance of spoilers for that portion of the game, not for every individual heading! If you skip ahead, you may miss a warning and accidentally spoil extremely significant story events for yourself!"

## Stasis Facility
After configuring the world's settings, the player awakens in a temporal stasis pod at the [[Stasis Facility]] to the news that several stasis pods have flatlined, and they are being evacuated. The player assumes the role of one of the [[Stasis Eight]], a group of eight high-ranking officials from the [[Empire of Avsohm]] who were frozen in time (this information is not directly told to the player, except through the [[Stasis Subject Roster]] book. From exploring the facility, the player finds that they entered stasis due to some kind of emergency, and that an extremely long amount of time (revealed later to be over a thousand years) has passed. The player is able to escape by taking a hint from one of the nearby holotexts, and emerges to the surface, just south of the [[Primal Caverns]].

## Terminus
After briefly exploring the world, the player will find a white and purple Avsohmic warp tower (most likely the [[Capital Valley]] tower). Upon climbing this tower and pressing the button atop it, the player will be transported to the [[Terminus Network|Terminus]], a dormant fast travel hub used by Avsohm. The Terminus is initially dark, but upon entering the compass dispensary in the Central Towers wing, [[avSYS]]—the AI that runs the Terminus—will recognize the player-character's security clearance and reactivate the Terminus. It will then inform the player that due to a network linkage failure, all existing towers need to be manually re-linked, establishing the fundamental mode of story progression. 

## Av'Sal Repository
While this is not necessarily the next step in all playthroughs, the [[Av'Sal Repository]] is a likely next step for many players, as there are signs pointing the player towward [[Av'Sal|the ruined Avsohmic capital]], and there is no amount of tower linkage required to enter the repository. Beneath the city of Av'Sal itself, on its central island, the player can find another holo-door, similar to the one at the Stasis Facility, and it can be opened in the same way.

Inside, the player finds a large repository containing information on important Avsohmic sites (story locations) throughout the realm, although only those that have been visited will have an active holotext entry. In the back of the repository, the hilt of an extremely powerful spear known as the [[Mythbreaker]] can be found floating in a chamber, along with notes describing the spear, which has been split into pieces held in other secure locations.

## Ancillary Research Facility 
Upon reaching 25% tower linkage (8 towers), avSYS will give the player a compass and request their presence at the [[Ancillary Research Facility]] in [[Sal'Mevir]]. The player can then follow that compass to the research facility in southeastern [[Purity Peaks]], where they can discover some old Avsohmic technology and research logs, documenting the advent of the very temporal stasis pods they woke up in. Through exploitation of the Temporal Engine, the player is able to gain access to the sealed-off main building, which contains the left blade fragment of the [[Mythbreaker]] and the [[Avsohm'Kohl]] legendary item (Drehmal's only version of the elytra).

## Exodus Vault 
Upon reaching 50% tower linkage (16 towers), avSYS will give the player another compass, pointing them towards the [[Exodus Citadel]] in [[Nimahj Swamp]]. At this facility, the player must solve a puzzle to open the door to the large underwater [[Exodus Vault]], the headquarters of [[Blue Exodus]], the primary military branch of Avsohm's government. 

Within, the player can find several holotexts and books that dive further into Avsohm's inner machinations. The legendary [[Warp Horse]] items are also found in this location, as well as the right blade fragment of the [[Mythbreaker]]. The vault exits out into the [[Anyr'Nogur]] desert.

## Inert Mythbreaker
At any point after obtaining the two blade fragments, the player can return to the Av'Sal Repository and connect the pieces together by throwing them onto the platform in front of the hilt. When both fragments have been re-attached, the player can claim the Inert Mythbreaker from the repository.

## Admin Wing 
Upon reaching 75% tower linkage (24 towers), the player will be given one more compass by avSYS, pointing to the [[Admin Wing|Administrative Wing]] of the Av'Sal Repository. Here, the first portion of the 75% event takes place.

At the back entrance to the Admin Wing, the player learns a mechanic to bypass the security checkpoint, and is given access to the previously hidden rooms in the repository. These include even further glimpses into the more secretive projects of Avsohm, repeatedly hinting at a grand "apotheosis" plan constructed by its final emperor, [[Anyr]]. The player opens a door to the main repository, and hears a transmission from an Avsohmic official named [[Verpyne]], requesting reinforcements aboard the greatest ship in the Avsohmic fleet: [[The Aphelion]]. The player is redirected back to the Terminus, where the second portion of the 75% event begins.

## The Aphelion 
When returning to the Terminus after being prompted to do so in the Admin Wing, the player will gain access to a new wing in the Outer Towers section of the Terminus. At the end of this wing is a small space shuttle that takes the player to [[The Aphelion]]. 

Aboard the Aphelion, the player navigates through the ship via maintenance tunnels, uncovering a significant amount of information on Avsohmic studies regarding outer space, incredibly strong materials, and high concentrations of Primal Energy. It is revealed that Avsohm attempted to peer outside of their realm (functionally a solar system), but were stopped by The Veil, seemingly a space-time bubble that physically keeps the realm contained, and cannot be seen through. With this attempt foiled, they turned their attention to the divine moon of [[Lo'Dahr]], which the Aphelion is currently orbiting.

The player then manages to navigate around the outside of the ship, through the vacuum of space, to a hangar bay containing a prototype warp tower, and activates an injection sequence, which drops the tower down and out of the ship. A few seconds later, the player can then press another button in the room to be transported to the landing spot of the tower: a lake on Lo'Dahr.

!!! danger "![Spoiler Door](/assets/img/spoiler_door.png)"

## Core Facility 
Upon first landing on Lo'Dahr, a likely first step will be following a compass found on the Aphelion to the [[Core Facility]], just east of the town of [[Naharja]]. This facility, whose function is not immediately clear, appears small at first, containing only a slightly fuzzy map of the moon's habitable area, a few blank holotext spots, and a security checkpoint reminiscent of that at the entrance to the Admin Wing. 

The map highlights three other Avsohmic facilities, which are the next intended story locations on the moon.
