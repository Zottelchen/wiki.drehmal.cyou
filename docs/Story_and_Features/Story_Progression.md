# Story Progression

--8<-- "spoiler.md"

In addition to its gameplay features and massive open world, Drehmal: Apotheosis adds a rich, original story spread across several different locations throughout the realm, slowly revealing more to the player about their origin, the fate of [[Avsohm|the powerful ancient empire]] that they came from, and the forces that govern the realm's existence.

Much of the story is divided into sections based on the player's network linkage percentage, which is increased by finding, climbing, and linking [[Terminus Network#Towers|Avsohmic warp towers]] found throughout the world, linking exploration to story progression. After reaching 25%, 50%, and 75% completion (8, 16, and 24 towers linked, respectively), the player will be prompted by [[avSYS]] to visit a pertinent location in the world, giving them a compass leading to that location in the Terminus' compass dispensary. The sequences which take place at these locations, mostly locked behind their respective completion percentages, are known as the 25%, 50%, and 75% completion events. Several spoiler warnings on this wiki, and in other discussions around this map, rely on these milestones. After completing the (spoiler-heavy) 75% event, the player can initiate an end-game sequence and does not necessarily have to link any more towers to finish the story.

The following sections provide an overview of the story's progression, in (approximate) chronological order. Distinct spoiler warnings are given for each section where applicable, and each section links to the page for that story location, which contains more in-depth information on the story at that location as well as more gameplay-oriented information.

!!! warning "If you have not completed the map yourself, do NOT navigate to later headings using the outline feature on the right side of your screen! Spoiler warnings appear throughout this page before the *first* instance of spoilers for that portion of the game, not for every individual heading. If you skip ahead, you may miss a warning and accidentally spoil extremely significant story events for yourself!"

## Stasis Facility

![[stasis_inside.png]]
> The room in the Stasis Facility where the player wakes up.

After configuring the world's settings, the player awakens in a temporal stasis pod at the [[Stasis Facility]] to the news that several stasis pods have flatlined, and they are being evacuated. The player assumes the role of one of the [Stasis Eight](/Lore/Historical_Figures/Avsohm/Stasis_Eight/), a group of eight high-ranking officials from the [[Avsohm|Empire of Avsohm]] who were frozen in time (this information is not directly told to the player, except through the [[Stasis Subject Roster]] book). From exploring the facility, the player finds that they entered stasis due to some kind of emergency, and that an extremely long amount of time (revealed later to be over a thousand years) has passed. The player is able to escape by taking a hint from one of the nearby holotexts, and emerges to the surface, just south of the [[Primal Caverns]].

![[stasis_outside.png]]
> The view that the player surfaces to.

## Terminus
After briefly exploring the world, the player will find a white and purple Avsohmic warp tower (most likely the [[Capital Valley]] tower). Upon climbing this tower and pressing the button atop it, the player will be transported to the [[Terminus Network|Terminus]], a dormant fast travel hub once used by Avsohm. The Terminus is initially dark, but upon entering the compass dispensary in the Central Towers wing, [[avSYS]]—the AI that runs the Terminus—will recognize the player-character's security clearance and reactivate the Terminus. It will then inform the player that due to a network linkage failure, all existing towers need to be manually re-linked, establishing the fundamental mode of story progression. 

## Av'Sal Repository
While this is not necessarily the next step in all playthroughs, the [[Av'Sal Repository]] is a likely next step for many players, as there are signs pointing the player toward [[Av'Sal|the ruined Avsohmic capital]], and there is no amount of tower linkage required to enter the repository. Beneath the capitol building on the city's central island, the player can find another holo-door, similar to the one at the Stasis Facility, and it can be opened in the same way.

Inside, the player finds a large repository containing information on important Avsohmic sites (story locations) throughout the realm, although only those that have been visited will have an active holotext entry. In the back of the repository, the hilt of an extremely powerful spear known as the [[Mythbreaker]] can be found floating in a chamber, along with notes describing the spear, which has been split into pieces that are held in other secure locations.

!!! danger "![Spoiler Door](/assets/img/spoiler_door.png)"

## Ancillary Research Facility/Sal'Mevir (25% SPOILERS)
Upon reaching 25% tower linkage (8 towers), avSYS will give the player a compass and request their presence at the Ancillary Research Facility in [[Sal'Mevir]]. The player can then follow that compass to the research facility, which is in southeastern [[Purity Peaks]]. 

![[salmevir_temporal_engine.png]]
> Sal'Mevir.

Here, they can discover some old Avsohmic technology and research logs, documenting the advent of the very temporal stasis pods they woke up in. Through exploitation of the Temporal Engine, the player is able to gain access to the sealed-off main building, which contains the left blade fragment of the [[Mythbreaker]] and the [[Avsohm'Kohl]] legendary item (Drehmal's only version of the elytra).

!!! danger "WARNING!"

!!! danger "The next two sections contains spoilers for the 50% completion story event." 

!!! danger "If you have not played through the entirety of the 50% story event at Exodus Citadel, all the way through to emerging from the facility back to the surface, then it is recommended that you DO NOT continue reading this article."

!!! danger "![Spoiler Door](/assets/img/spoiler_door.png)"

## Exodus Vault (50% SPOILERS)
Upon reaching 50% tower linkage (16 towers), avSYS will give the player another compass, pointing them towards the [[Exodus Citadel]] in [[Nimahj Swamp]]. At this facility, the player must solve a puzzle to open the door to the large, underwater [[Exodus Vault]]. This site was the former headquarters of [[Blue Exodus]], the primary military branch of Avsohm's government. 

Within, the player can find several holotexts and books that dive further into Avsohm's inner machinations. The legendary [[Warp Horse]] items are also found in this location, as well as the right blade fragment of the [[Mythbreaker]]. The vault exits out into the [[Anyr'Nogur]] desert.

## Inert Mythbreaker
At any point after obtaining the two blade fragments, the player can return to the Av'Sal Repository and connect the pieces together by throwing them onto the platform in front of the hilt. When both fragments have been re-attached, the player can claim the Inert Mythbreaker from the repository. Although this version of the Mythbreaker still holds [mythical](/Items/Mythical_Weapons) status, it is nowhere near its true potential strength, as it needs to be charged using a massive quantity of [[Primal Energy|primal energy]].

!!! danger "The following sections contain spoilers for the 75% completion story event. This is a huge milestone that you specifically should NOT spoil yourself on through a wiki! It's not worth it!"

!!! danger "![Spoiler Door](/assets/img/spoiler_door.png)"

## Admin Wing (75% SPOILERS BEGIN HERE)
Upon reaching 75% tower linkage (24 towers), the player will be given one more compass by avSYS, pointing to the [[Admin Wing|Administrative Wing]] of the Av'Sal Repository. Here, the first portion of the 75% event takes place.

At the back entrance to the Admin Wing, the player learns a mechanic to bypass the security checkpoint, and is given access to the previously hidden rooms in the repository. These include even further glimpses into the more secretive projects of Avsohm, repeatedly hinting at a grand "apotheosis" plan constructed by its final emperor, [[Anyr]]. The player opens a door to the main repository, and hears a transmission from an Avsohmic official named Verpyne, requesting reinforcements aboard the greatest ship in the Avsohmic fleet: [[Aphelion|The Aphelion]]. The player is redirected back to the Terminus, where the second portion of the 75% event begins.

## The Aphelion 
Upon returning to the Terminus after being prompted to do so in the Admin Wing, the player will gain access to a new section of the Outer Towers wing of the Terminus. At the end of this section is a small space shuttle that takes the player to the. 

![[aphelion_outside.png]]
> The Aphelion.

Aboard the Aphelion, the player navigates through the ship via maintenance tunnels, uncovering a significant amount of information on Avsohmic studies regarding outer space, incredibly strong materials, and high concentrations of primal energy. The player can find the first bits of information about Avsohm's deeper ambitions here, shown through holotexts that espouse Anyr's desire to rule over the entirety of the universe after Avsohm's research found evidence of other realms. It is revealed that Avsohm attempted to peer outside of their realm (functionally a solar system), but were stopped by the [[Veil]], seemingly a space-time bubble that physically keeps the realm contained, and cannot be seen through. With this attempt foiled, they turned their attention to the divine moon of Lo'Dahr, which the Aphelion is currently orbiting.

The player then manages to navigate around the outside of the ship, through the vacuum of space, to a hangar bay containing a prototype warp tower. Here, they can activate an injection sequence, which drops the tower down and out of the ship. A few seconds later, the player can then press another button in the room to be transported to the landing spot of the tower: a lake on [[Lo'Dahr]].

!!! danger "SPOILER WARNING!"

!!! danger "The following sections contain significant spoilers for the 75% completion event and its associated late-game areas."

!!! danger "Unless you have FINISHED the 75% Completion Sequence, **ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO THE "Apotheosis" ADVANCEMENT**, we strongly advise that you **DO NOT** continue to read this article, as this **will** interfere with your ability to discover crucial aspects of the map for yourself."

!!! danger "![Spoiler Door](/assets/img/spoiler_door.png)"

## Core Facility (POST-75% SPOILERS BEGIN HERE)
Upon first landing on Lo'Dahr, a likely first step will be following a compass found on the Aphelion to the [[Core Facility]], just east of the town of [[Naharja]]. This facility, whose function is not immediately clear, appears small at first, containing only a slightly fuzzy map of the moon's habitable area, a few blank holotext spots, and a security checkpoint reminiscent of that at the entrance to the Admin Wing. 

The map found here highlights the rough locations of three other Avsohmic facilities, which are the next intended story locations on the moon. Each of these three facilities is intended to teach a player a mechanic that can then be used in the Core Facility.

## Resupply Depot
The [[Resupply Depot]], located in the southeast of Lo'Dahr in [[Rihelma's Domain]], was the first Avsohmic facility built on the moon, and is one of the four main Avsohmic facilities found on Lo'Dahr. It is situated on a floating island in the sky, and acted as a spaceport for Avsohm.

Within the facility, the player can find holotexts about the first expeditions on Lo'Dahr and some references to the other facilities, as well as a puzzle whose solution can be applied to the Core Facility.

## Catalyst Inscription Facility
The [[Inscription Complex]], located in [[Loe's Domain]] in the far southwest, was the center for inscription of [[Arcanism|runic]] catalysts on the Divine Moon, allowing the empire to use the full extent of their technology on Lo'Dahr. It is found clinging to the underside of a glacier, and is another of the four main Avsohmic facilities found on Lo'Dahr.

Within the facility, the player can find holotexts pertaining to Avsohm's activity on the moon, as well as a puzzle whose solution can be applied to the Core Facility.

## Warp Ring Research Installation
The [[Ring Facility|Ring Research Installation]] is another of the four main Avsohmic facilities found on Lo'Dahr, found in [[Khive's Domain]] in the west. Situated within Lake Khanak, the facility was formerly a hydroelectric power plant, but was converted to a facility dedicated to the study of the warp rings found in Khive's Domain, a technology that eventually inspired Avsohmic warp technology.

Within the facility, the player can find holotexts and books pertaining to the research at the facility and its implications for the Terminus network, as well as a puzzle whose solution can be applied to the Core Facility.

## Numencore
At any point after arriving on Lo'Dahr, the player can solve the puzzle at the Core Facility, accessing the [[Numencore]], but the solution is not readily apparent unless they have visited the other three locations. 

After passing through the admin-wing-like security checkpoint, the player comes to a hall with an inactive warp ring. By activating the warp ring using the solution from the Inscription Facility and applying the knowledge of the other two locations, the player can use this warp ring to access an extension of the Core Facility by the Numencore, Avsohm's true main target on the moon. 

The Numencore, located deep within the center of the moon itself, is a massive source of primal energy—the source of [[Khive|Mystic Elder Khive]]'s power. There are holotexts throughout the facility which establish that Avsohm's plan was to charge the Mythbreaker at the Numencore, use the spear's power to tear a hole in the Veil, and peer beyond the edges of the realm, but this operation was indefinitely postponed for fear of incurring Khive's wrath, and Avsohm fell before they had the chance to attempt this plan.

## Mythbreaker Run (LATE-GAME SPOILERS BEGIN HERE)
![[numencore_core.png]]
> The Numencore, with the Mythbreaker in its charging slot.

Progression beyond this point requires the player to follow through on a version of Avsohm's plan found in the Numencore. They must charge the Inert Mythbreaker at the Numencore and engage in a chase sequence, evading enemies and magical projectiles sent from the sky by the greatly angered Khive, who [[Khive_Dialogue.md|speaks directly]] to the player. The destination of this run can be ascertained before this point through exploration, or through a "Primal Energy Radar" found at the Core Facility, pointing to [[Mt. Yavhlix]]. 

The mountain is referenced several times before this point as a pertinent location for the empire, but upon visiting it, the facility inside is blocked off by an indestructible veilstone door (the same door used for spoilers on this wiki!). However, several sources, including some just outside the door, suggest that a powerful beam of primal energy could blast the door down.

If the player is able to navigate to the Mt. Yavhlix door with their charged Mythbreaker in hand (the weapon reverts to its inert state over the course of about 8 real minutes), then the Mystic Elder will relent, warning the player to avoid listening to the "whispers" within the mountain, and the weapon's Core Collapse ability can be used to open the door. The weapon disappears upon successful use.

## Primary Energy Collection Facility { data-search-exclude }
![[primary_collection.png]]
> The Primary Energy Collection Facility.

Inside the door is the main Avsohmic facility built within Mt. Yavhlix: the [[Primary Energy Collection Facility]]. This facility, as hinted at in other areas of the map, was built to harness a massive source of primal energy found deep within the mountain itself, to power the entire empire. However, a horrific calamity seems to have started there, triggering the [[Fall of Avsohm|fall of the empire]]. Workers were consumed by beings known as "Those Beyond", and dark orbs that seemingly ate perfectly circular holes in things and people completely destroyed or rendered useless the vast majority of Avsohm's government and infrastructure.

Inside of the facility, the player is [[Mt._Yavhlix_Dialogue.md|spoken to]] by a mysterious voice egging them on to an unclear goal, repeatedly telling them that there is "NOTHING TO LOSE." The player progresses by finding and turning on three override switches, which open the way to the energy source at the top of the facility: a tear in space and time, exposing the realm of Drehmal to the [[Nothing]]—a primordial void filled with extreme quantities of primal energy and unknown beings. By gathering 12 "Oculi of Nothing" and using them to override the seal (open the end portal), the player is granted access through the tear, into the [[Nothing Island|Nothing]].

## The Nothing { data-search-exclude }
![[the_nothing.png]]
> The Nothing.

Inside the Nothing (very similar to the vanilla End dimension), the player is thrust into a fight against [[Tethlaen_Boss|Tethlaen]], the Aspect of Fear who has been missing for millennia. Upon killing Tethlaen, the regular Minecraft end portal appears in the center of the arena, and the player can enter it to see the vanilla Minecraft end credits and return to the Primary Collection Facility. 

This is not the end of the story.

!!! danger "WARNING!!! This section contains EXTREMELY SIGNIFICANT spoilers for end-game areas (after the Mt. Yavhlix dungeon)."

!!! danger "If you have not **FINISHED THE MAIN STORY OF THE MAP IN ITS ENTIRETY**, we strongly recommend that you DO NOT continue to read the contents of this article."

!!! danger "Note: The true end of the storyline will take you to a dedicated credits room, NOT the vanilla Minecraft end credits."

!!! danger "Consider yourself warned."

!!! danger "![Spoiler Door](/assets/img/spoiler_door.png)"

## Azimuth Labs (POST-YAV/END-GAME SPOILERS BEGIN HERE) { data-search-exclude }
Once the player returns to Mt. Yavhlix, they will be greeted by a voice in chat, which first appears as three yellow question marks. This voice tells the player that without Tethlaen, the realm is surely doomed, and that although the player already knows far too much, the voice will assist them in weaving the final threads of Avsohm's fate. 

The voice instructs the player to return to the Terminus, where it takes control of avSYS. It dispenses the Silent Thing, a [[Trinkets|trinket]] which directs the player to the [[Sunken Astral Body]], east of [[Dusps]].

At the Sunken Astral Body, the voice will manifest once again, summoning a bolt of energy to destroy a veilstone seal in the ground and grant the player access to [[Azimuth Labs]], the secret former headquarters of Avsohm's alchemical branch, [[Red Dawn]]. Here, the player can find evidence of unethical experimentation and advanced military plans, making clear Avsohm's intention to completely overtake the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) and rule over all realms.

![[azimuth_gm.png]]
> The God Machine.

Eventually, the voice guides the player to the God Machine, a massive throne surrounded by an alchemical contraption that was intended to ascend Emperor Anyr to the level of a "god". However, the machine was activated prematurely, and the subsequent energy draw collapsed the entire Avsohmic energy grid, leading to the disconnection of all Terminus towers. The machine appears to have functioned properly, but nonetheless, Anyr died on the throne, his corpse still visible over a thousand years later.

The player is then told to return to the Terminus.

## Resonant Halls { data-search-exclude }
Back at the Terminus, the player is given another trinket, the Resonant Thing, which leads the player back to Mt. Yavhlix.

Deep within the Primary Energy Collection Facility, another veilstone seal can be found. At this point, the voice will once again dispose of the seal, granting the player access to the deepest recesses of Mt. Yavhlix: The [[Resonant Halls]]. These halls, guarded by unkillable enemies and protected by a massive labyrinth the player must navigate, contain one of Avsohm's greatest pieces of technology: the Resonant Eye.

![[resonant_eye.png]]
> The Resonant Eye.

The Resonant Eye is an extremely powerful divining lens, capable of peering beyond the Veil through the tear (the "Spiral Anomaly") present at Mt. Yavhlix. At the Eye, [15 total holotexts](/Story_and_Features/Holotexts/Post-Yav/Resonant_Halls/) can be found, containing research logs and notes on the first dives through the Eye. It is discovered in this facility that Tethlaen initially ventured into the rift to hold it closed from the inside, preventing primal energy from seeping into the realm and ultimately causing its demise. The Aspect and Avsohmic researchers, particularly [[Orix Cehein]], developed a strong rapport and symbiotic relationship, but the premature firing of the God Machine and subsequent fall of Avsohm led Tethlaen to become isolated and uncared for once again, with his body and mind gradually breaking down until he was killed by the player.

With this revelation, the player is transported back outside the Halls, and instructed to return to the Terminus once again, with the voice extending an invitation to its [[Court of Nothing|Court]].

!!! danger "Alright, seriously. From this point on, you should ABSOLUTELY not read on unless you have finished the map yourself."

## Return to Stasis Facility { data-search-exclude }
At the Terminus, a final trinket is dispensed: The Rhythmic Thing. This item directs the player back to where they arose: the Stasis Facility.

At this point, the voice reveals their true identity: [[yellow|the Mythoclast]], the being at the center of all creation, an omnipotent mind that ultimately governs all souls and realms, including that of Drehmal, with far more power than any of the Aspects or [Deities](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Deities/). The Mythoclast gives the player a new rendition of the Mythbreaker (known in the community as the "True" Mythbreaker), and invites the player to their court, where the player is told that guests are expecting them.

The player is warned before entering that this is their final journey, as time flows differently where they're headed.

## Court of Nothing { data-search-exclude }
Upon stepping through the portal in the Stasis Facility, the player is transported to the Court of Nothing, the Mythoclast's court in which they judge all souls. Within the Court, the player fights the [[UH|reanimated forms]] of [[Ultva|Ultva Utofal]] and [[Hovadchear|Hovadchear Myrik]], the first two leaders of the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]], the most successful attempt to rebuild after Avsohm's fall. When the player defeats these two, another portal is opened, this time leading to the Maddened Path.

## Maddened Path { data-search-exclude }
![[maddened_path.png]]
> The Maddened Path.

The [[Maddened Path]] is home to the penultimate story sequence, taking place near the Heart of the Void. As the player traverses the shattered terrain, some of which is reminiscent of terrain found on [[Overworld|Drehmal]], the Mythoclast admits to the player that they were behind the fall of Avsohm, explaining that Avsohm came too close to claiming their own proverbial crown, and could not have been allowed to attain the degree of power which they desired.

They also tell the player that they have one final person for them to meet, and that this person has specifically requested to see you, the player. The Mythoclast wishes the player luck before leaving them to the final boss fight.

The final fight, in an arena at the end of the path, is against the [[Emissary of the Void]]. This two-phase boss appears like any other [[Drehmari]] wielding the scythe [[Oblivion]], but in his second phase, is revealed to be [[Drehn|Drehn Mal'Sohm]], the founder and first emperor of Avsohm. Drehn, who was a generally peaceful man, realized too late that he had created an empire that would stop at nothing to attain power, and after his death, his soul begged the Mythoclast to destroy Avsohm. This would not come to pass immediately, but he was kept alive as the Mythoclast's pawn, up until his death at the player's hands.

After defeating the Emissary, one final portal is opened.

## True End { data-search-exclude }
As the player steps through this portal, they are returned back to the Stasis Facility, and the [[True End]] sequence plays out. The player finds that the Mythoclast's warning about time was, in fact, not an empty one, as Drehmal is not at all how they remember it.

In the end, the player is offered closure, transporting them to the end credits room and marking the end of the story.
