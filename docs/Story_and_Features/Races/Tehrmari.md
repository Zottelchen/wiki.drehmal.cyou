> The 6 possible skins for Tehrmari villagers.

The **Tehrmari** are an ascended, draconic humanoid race. They are found very sparingly on [[Overworld|Drehmal]] by the time that the player awakens from stasis, but can be found primarily in the [[Purity Peaks]] region. They are re-skinned Minecraft villagers.
