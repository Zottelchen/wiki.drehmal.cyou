# Maelmari

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Maelmari** are the ascended race of the Chaos Deity [[Maelihs]]. 

Replacing vanilla Minecraft piglins, Maelmari appear as humanoid creatures with bright red skin. They follow vanilla piglin mechanics, meaning that regular Maelmari are hostile toward the player by default, but can be pacified with gold, while Maelmari Brutes are always hostile.
