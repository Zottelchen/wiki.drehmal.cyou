# Virmari

The **Virmari** are the ascended race of the goddess [[Virtuo]]. Created from [[Drehmari]] that Virtuo deems worthy of ascension, the Virmari have additional powers, including increased strength, longevity, and flight.

Very few Virmari remain on Drehmal today, as most of them left with their Goddess at the end of the Third Avihm, and those who remain have spread far across the world.

All Virmari remaining in the map are hostile.

## Ascension

Virmari begin as Drehmari, who make pilgrimage to the [[Kiln of Virtuo]] and are deemed worthy by the Goddess herself. An [[Untitled Books#Virmari|untitled book]] asserts that the process was rigorous and that only the most perfect were ascended, and were first created to fight in the [[Deity War]] against [[Maelihs]].

## Physical Characteristics

Virmari are blue-skinned, and described as appearing "perfect" or "angelic" by most sources. Their horns become crystalline, like their patron goddess, and one source suggests that they even gain the power of flight.

## History

Virmari were first created in early Av2 by Virtuo after her first skirmishes with Maelihs, picked from her most devout followers. Virmari would come to be the main force in her army during the [[Deity War]].

After the Deity War, Virmari spread far and wide throughout the realm, intermingling with [[Drehmari]] and often leading their societies. Virmari led the Kingdom of [[Highfall]], the [[Empire of Vir]], and Virtuo's Grand Parish in the Second Avihm. They would also go to found [[Teiruun Monastery]].

Virmari were largely diplomatic and peaceful, spreading Virtuo's faith throughout the realm. Some of the most important figures in the realm, including [[Vahid]], were Virmari.

With the Departure of Virtuo to Eastern [[Xivrhynt]], all of the Goddess's highest-ranking Virmari left with her. Almost all of those who remained were massively disenchanted by this perceived betrayal, and either converted to a new faith or committed to a life of seclusion. The Kiln staff were greatly depleted, and Virtuo's faith took a significant hit realm-wide.

## Spread

Lore-wise, Virmari can still be found sparingly in the continent, but in-game, they can only be found in two places:

- [[Teiruun Monastery]], where Abbot Balthysar appears as a miniboss. <br>
- [[Star-Rise Bastion]], where a group of Virmari have converted to [[Rihelma]]'s faith and are hostile to outsiders.

## Extras

Any piglin brute can obtain the Virmari skin by simply being renamed "Virmari", with commands or a name tag. This results in them taking on the skin below:
