# Virmari

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

The **Virmari** are the ascended race of the goddess [[Virtuo]]. Created from [[Drehmari]] that Virtuo deems worthy of ascension, the Virmari have additional powers, including increased strength, longevity, and flight.

Very few Virmari remain on Drehmal today, as most of them left with their Goddess at the end of the Third Avihm, and those who remain have spread far across the world.
