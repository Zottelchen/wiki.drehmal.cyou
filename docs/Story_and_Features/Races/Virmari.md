# Virmari

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

The **Virmari** are the ascended race of the goddess [[Virtuo]]. Created from [[Drehmari]] that Virtuo deems worthy of ascension, the Virmari have additional powers, including increased strength, longevity, and flight.

Very few Virmari remain on Drehmal today, as most of them left with their Goddess, and most of those who did not chose to follow other ventures, spreading out across the realm.
