# Terminus Network

![[Sahd1.webp]]{ align=right width="300" }

The Terminus network is a system of transportation that the player can use to teleport between different locations across the map. Many distinct white and purple towers can be found scattered throughout the world, and at the top of them are buttons that will teleport the player to "the Terminus". The Terminus is a central hub where you can teleport to any tower that has already been used via buttons lining the walls. 



In order to progress through the story, the player must unlock certain numbers of Terminus towers. The compass dispensary inside of the Terminus is also where the player receives story-related directions from avSYS, in the form of compasses or other items.
