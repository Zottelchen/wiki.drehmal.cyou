> The Central Towers Hall in the Terminus

The Terminus is a transporation hub that the player can use to teleport between different locations across the map. Many distinct white and purple towers can be found scattered throughout the world (typically one per region), and at the top of them are buttons that will teleport the player to the Terminus. The Terminus is a central hub where players can teleport to any tower that has already been used via buttons lining the walls. Each button is placed in a room with scenery resembling its corresponding tower's region. If a tower has not yet been used, its room in the Terminus will be walled off by gray stained glass.

Towers are grouped into four categories inside the Terminus; Western Towers, Eastern Towers, Central Towers and Outer Towers.

In order to progress through the story, the player must unlock certain numbers of Terminus towers. The compass dispensary inside of the Terminus is also where the player receives story-related directions from avSYS, in the form of specially-oriented compasses or other items.

In the center of the terminus, below a transparent floor, there is a rough physical map of [[Overworld|Drehmal]] with the locations of towers marked by light rods.

## Towers

![[cv_tower.png]]
> The [[Capital Valley]] Terminus tower, often the first that the player will come across. 

Terminus towers are recognizable by their late [[Empire of Avsohm|Avsohmic]] architecture, consisting primarily of quartz, with a purple-colored central pillar. The tops of the towers are small, partially-enclosed platforms with bedrock floors, covered with roofs of stained glass divided into four quarters (red, blue, green and yellow), representing the four different tower categories. Inside this structure are four buttons on a single block that teleport the player to the Terminus, each with a sign above displaying the tower's name. 

Different Terminus towers have different features, often being guarded by enemies or having parkour leading to the top. Most towers do not have direct access to the top, meaning players must pillar up or use some other means of reaching the button.

Players at the top of towers will receive the Feather Falling II effect for 15 seconds (continuously replenished until they exit), allowing for safe descent to the ground. If the player has unlocked every tower and gotten the "*Fully Online!*" advancement, they will also be given 90 seconds of Speed II upon teleporting to a tower from the Terminus.

Locating, climbing, and linking towers is the primary method of story progression early in the map, and towers can be visited in nearly any order. Three towers are locked behind story progression, some at the 75% milestone and one by the end-game Mt. Yavhlix dungeon, but all others can be found in the open world and accessed before the end-game, in whatever order the player likes.

The locations of Terminus towers are given by the map in the Terminus, and more precisely by the regional maps sold by [[Adventuring Merchant|Adventuring Merchants]].

Upon using a tower's button, the message "//INITIATING PHASE WARP...// will appear in chat. If the tower is being used for the first time, this message will be followed by a message updating the player on their total linkage % (each tower increases linkage by 3.1%).

## Story (Up to 75%)
Typically, the Terminus is first accessed through the [[Capital Valley]] tower, found just off of the road between the [[Stasis Facility]] and [[Drabyel]], but almost any tower can be the first. Upon the player's first arrival in the Terminus, the inside halls are dark and inactive, except for the compass dispensary at the end of the Central Towers wing. When the player enters this area, avSYS will check their credentials and activate the facility, turning lights back on and prompting the player to manually re-link all towers, establishing the connection between network linkage and story progression.

At the 25%, 50%, and 75% milestones, the player will be given a lodestone compass at the compass directory, pointing them towards the locations of those story events. The Terminus plays a particularly significant role in the 75% event, detailed in the section below (beware of spoilers).

After visiting the [[Admin Wing]] in the [[Av'Sal Repository]] and upgrading their rank, the player gains access to a new section of the Terminus at the end of the Outer Towers hallway that houses the buttons for [[The Aphelion]] and [[Lo'Dahr]] (not revealed until unlocked). At the end of this passage is a button which teleports the player to the Terminus's docking bay (actually in the space dimension, as opposed to the Drehmal dimension where the rest of the Terminus exists). Here, the player can board a space shuttle to be transported to the Aphelion and they can recall the shuttle with a button upon revisit.

The Terminus was born out of Avsohm's efforts to [[Ring Research Installation#Lore|study the warp rings]] in [[Khive's Domain]], the source of the ampire's initial knowledge on teleportation magic. By studying and reverse-engineering the rings' magic runes, Avsohm was eventually able to create rudimentary versions of the warp towers found across the map, which were gradually perfected and spread across the realm.

However, the warp tech was deemed inefficient due to the fact that each ring could only connect to its one linked ring, and vice versa. Thus, [[Vortu]], an Avsohmic officer aboard the Aphelion, came up with the idea of a central hub, where important locations could all be linked to, allowing for extremely rapid transfer of personnel, cargo, and energy around the empire. 

The Terminus itself was built as a satellite to [[The Aphelion]], allowing for direct access of Avsohm's flagship from the Terminus.

Upon defeating [[Tethlaen]] in [[The Nothing]], the player will begin the end-game sequence, in which they are spoken to by [[yellow|a mysterious voice]]. This sequence sees the player return to the Terminus three times, each time being given a trinket that leads them to one of the main [end-game locations](/Story_and_Features/Story_Locations/End-Game_Locations/). During this time, avSYS appears to be possessed by the being speaking to the player.
