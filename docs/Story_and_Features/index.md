# Story and Features

The map of Drehmal introduces many new features to the game as well as its own [storyline[Storyline]].

## Features

### [[Terminus Network]]

Scattered around the map are Terminus towers, white and purple spires from the top of which you can teleport to the Terminus. The Terminus is a hub that allows you to teleport to any tower that you have unlocked previously by finding and using. Unlocking Terminus towers is a part of story progression.

### Special Merchants

Merchants that specialize in selling specific items (usually related to their surroundings) can be found at significant locations throughout the map.

[Runic Blacksmiths[Runic Blacksmith]] are present in most settlements, and some other populated structures (or random, solitary locations), indicated by blue striped canvas. They sell [artisan items[Artisan Items]], which have stat modifiers and lore pertaining to where the blacksmith is.

[Adventuring Merchants[Adventuring Merchsnt]] are present at all official towns on [Drehmal[Drehmal (Place)], indicated by striped red and orange canvas. They sell a map of the town's region (showing some nearby landmarks), a map of Drehmal showing the locations of all official towns (except for [[New Sahd]]) on the continent, bundles and an additional item that differs with each merchant.

### [[Special Items]]

Many custom items can be found around the map, and these items have different classes; trinket, artifact, artisan, relic, legendary and mythical. Special items each have their own descriptions and usually stat modifiers, and some classes of items have unique sprites/models.

### [[Devotion]]

Devotion is a mechanic that allows players to give offerings to certain [Aspects or deities[Higher Beings]], in the form of specific items that appease them. Offers are given at devotion altars dedicated to the recipient. The more items offered, the more the player's devotion to that aspect/deity increases, and as it increases they will be gifted rewards, including [[Relics]] (offhand stat-modifying items).
