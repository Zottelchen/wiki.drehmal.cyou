# Story and Features

The map of Drehmal fundamentally revolves around its story, and the special mechanics that it adds to the game of Minecraft. Articles relating to the main story of Drehmal: Apotheosis and the unique features tied to the map are found in this section of the wiki.

## Main Story

The main story of Drehmal takes place in many different locations, linked directly to exploration. Story progression is tied to [[Terminus Network|Terminus network]] linkage in the early game, with milestones at 25%, 50%, and 75% linkage prompting the player to visit different story areas. Towers can be linked in almost any order, and while the story events are intended to be experienced in a particular sequence, you may explore the map at your own pace and with your own unique path.

For a summary of the main story, see [[Story Progression]].

Individual pages on each story location, including a summary of the story events there, gameplay tips, and lore on the location in-universe, can be found [here](/Story_and_Features/Story_Locations/).

## [[Terminus Network]]

Scattered around the map are Terminus towers, white and purple spires from the top of which you can teleport to the Terminus. The Terminus is a hub that allows you to teleport to any tower that you have unlocked previously by finding and using. Unlocking Terminus towers is the primary method through which the story is progressed.

## [Holotexts](/Story_and_Features/Holotexts/)

At major story locations, the player will discover holographic text images, known as holotexts. These short pieces of writing provide important story information and hints for puzzles in the area. A full list of all 139 holotexts found in Drehmal, organized by location with coordinates, descriptions, images, and alt text transcriptions, can be found in this section of the wiki.

## Special Merchants

Merchants that specialize in selling specific items (usually related to their surroundings) can be found at significant locations throughout the map.

[[Runic Blacksmith|Runic Blacksmiths]] are present in most settlements, and some other populated structures (or random, solitary locations), indicated by blue striped canvas. They sell [[Artisan Items|artisan items]], which have stat modifiers and lore pertaining to where the blacksmith is.

[[Adventuring Merchant|Adventuring Merchants]] are present at all official towns on [[Overworld|Drehmal]], indicated by striped red and orange canvas. They sell a map of the town's region (showing some nearby landmarks), a map of Drehmal showing the locations of all [official towns](/World/Settlements/Official_Towns/) on the mainland continent, bundles, and an additional item that differs with each merchant.

## [[Devotion]]

Devotion is a mechanic that allows players to give offerings to certain [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) and [Deities](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Deities/), in the form of specific items that appease them. Offerings are given at devotion altars dedicated to the recipient, 11 of which are found throughout the world. The more items offered, the more the player's devotion to that Aspect/Deity increases. As it increases, they will be gifted rewards, including relics (offhand stat-modifying items).

## [[Soundtrack]]

Drehmal boasts a [custom OST](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXvAOqL1yGd2s1dBYMoNzLDnpJNK6nWvm) created by Chris Nesja and Penngo, with tracks corresponding to individual towns and areas, as well as general exploration music. Every official town on the map has its own theme song. There are also leitmotifs for certain entities that are present throughout multiple tracks. Many tracks can be listened to at (almost) any time in-game with the item [[AvPod]], as long as the player has heard them at some point before.
