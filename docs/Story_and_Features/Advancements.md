Advancements are sorted into one of six (6) categories:

- **Fabled Equipment:** Acquired upon receiving legendary or mythical items.
- **Drehmal:** General and vanilla advancements.
- **Discoveries:** Advancements achieved by visiting significant locations.
- **Primordial:** Unlocked by completing tasks as part of the storyline.
- **[REDACTED]:** Advancements from to a late-game area tied to the 75% completion event.
- **???:** - Secret advancements. The ??? tab is not revealed until one of these advancements is obtained. They require advanced knowledge of the map and its mechanics.
