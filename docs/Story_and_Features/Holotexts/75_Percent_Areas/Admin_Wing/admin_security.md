## Transcription
> After a soldier entered the **Administration Wing** unknowingly carrying a reconnaissance device on her, Alchemical Secretary Ahdul ordered a new scanning mechanism be put in place to prevent further breaches of that sort. The scan didn’t pick up the bug because of the soldier’s armor. So, rather than making a whole new mechanism, the new policy is to have personnel **strip their armor and hold completely still for a good long while until the clearance alarm goes off**. It’s not exactly what Secretary Ahdul asked for, but it’s good enough! He’ll be none the wiser.
