> **The Aphelion’s** tenure as a research vessel is quickly coming to a close. She’s done quite a lot for our empire, and soon enough she’ll be returning to port. Lord Anyr has ordered her to be fully outfitted for **combat** once she’s returned. Supposedly, she’s to play a major role in this whole **"Apotheosis"** plan his majesty has brewing.
