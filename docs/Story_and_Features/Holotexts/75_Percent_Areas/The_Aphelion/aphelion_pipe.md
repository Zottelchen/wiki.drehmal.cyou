> The slag this damned reactor is generating keeps clogging this pipe! Really starting to get on my nerves, I’ve had to fix it at least five times at this point. It’s tough stuff, too. We dealt with a similar issue during my tenure in Yavhlix, but that byproduct was always more like goo. This slag is solid and almost metallic. If we make more vessels equipped with this sort of reactor, we’ll have to figure out some kind of solution. If this pipe clogs again just ask Argyn to fix it.
