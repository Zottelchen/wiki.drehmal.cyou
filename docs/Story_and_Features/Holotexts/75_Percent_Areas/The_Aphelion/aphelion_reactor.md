## Transcription
> By transporting energy directly from the Terminus, we’ve got the reactor operating at maximum efficiency! Even the **primal slag** created by this process is incredibly powerful. Although it’s no longer charged, it’s still a **lightweight and durable material**. Shame we don’t have much of a use for it though, Rehntite does everything it can do but better. Once the buildup starts messing with efficiency, we’ll just briefly leave orbit and eject it all out into space.
