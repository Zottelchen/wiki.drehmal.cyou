This holotext can be found in the surveillance room aboard the [[Aphelion]]. It recounts how a crew member watching the [[Mt. Yavhlix|Yavhlix]] camera feed during Avsohm's fall was consumed by holes himself, suggesting that anyone who saw the actions of Those Beyond were taken themselves.

## Transcription
> Davehl was watching the **Yavhlix** feed… I watched him disappear. **Holes** began appearing all throughout his body until nothing was left. We’ve since lost contact with Yavhlix, and comms are malfunctioning all across the board. **What have we done?**
