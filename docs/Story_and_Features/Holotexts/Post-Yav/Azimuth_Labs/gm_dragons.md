> Apotheosis is nigh. We have one mere obstacle in our path. Mythbreaker must be charged, and for that we require the source of the Aspectsâ€™ power. The full might of our empire, combined with the ascended power of God Emperor Anyr, will bend them to our will. The Numencore will be ours, and any aspect that opposes us shall meet the same fate as their dear beloved Greatbeast. We are the new dragons. We are the true Aspects.
