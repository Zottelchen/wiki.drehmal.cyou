> The Eye activated on its own, the retina pool began filling with incomprehensible projections. Orix ordered the seal be put in place and left. He knows something we don't. An emergency transmission came through, it said the God Machine is being activated. The fools! The energy grid isn’t ready! They’re going to cause a network collapse! Oh by Drehmal, I’m going to be trapped in here… Someone, please save me! Orix! Thresa! Anyone!! I’m sorry!!! Wait… I hear a noise coming through the hallway. Hello? Who's there? Rescue?!
