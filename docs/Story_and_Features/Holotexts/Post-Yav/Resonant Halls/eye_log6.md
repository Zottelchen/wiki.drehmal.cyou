This holotext can be found at the Resonant Eye, deep within the [[Resonant Halls]]. It is concerned with the results of [[eye_dive3.md|the third dive]], which suggest that there are trillions of other realms.

> It’s been months and we’re still poring over all the data that poured in from dive three. The entire retina pool just filled with tiny points of light, exponentially increasing in speed until the entire room became blindingly bright. I’m afraid the Eye would have cracked if we hadn’t aborted the dive. It made one thing abundantly clear. We are not the only realm. We are very, very, VERY small. One signal we received was unspeakably larger than all the rest. The next dive will be focused to that signal. I’m afraid we may feel even smaller after that.
