> The Resonant Eye is Avsohmâ€™s greatest creation. More than avSYS, more than the Terminus. It is the single most complex catalyst ever beheld, made from only the purest and highest potentia rehntite. The millions of runes inscribed across it are so small that they are barely visible to the naked eye. By projecting a resonance observer particle through the Spiral Anomaly, we may receive data converted into images and sounds in the retina pool. We need it to see what lies beyond and why the flow of energy has begun to slow.
