> Wings. That’s about all we can make out from the projection. We aborted the dive early out of fear for what we might find, we weren’t prepared for a major discovery so immediately. We are going to attempt communication with Dive #02. I have already been approved for a fourth dive by Emperor Anyr should it be necessary.
