> Kahmas has just reported that the chassis for Mythbreaker has been completed. We need to ensure our current energy infrastructure could support the toll from charging it, so for now the blades are being separated and locked away. Wouldnâ€™t want to risk something that powerful falling into the wrong hands. Anyr intends to use it to confront whatever entity might have created it. If he can perform such a feat, slaying that which wields a weapon so powerful, then Anyr himself will have proven himself as an equal. Then, we might expand beyond.
