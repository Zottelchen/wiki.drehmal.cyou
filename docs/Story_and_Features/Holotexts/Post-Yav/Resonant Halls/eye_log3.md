> In order to observe the advance, we triggered an unlogged dive to watch through the retina pool. I almost wish we hadn’t. Forty-one soldiers and scientists, dead at the maw of the Ever-Fear. Workers here in the facility, completely unaware of what we’re doing down here, started experiencing widespread mental breaks. I could barely keep my own composure. CSO Eleis escaped, paralyzed from the neck down. When she could broadcast a signal, she told me not to abort. Orix has reassured me that Tethlaen will submit. I hope he’s right.
