> After our realization with dive three as to the nature of the stars, we attempted to send the Aphelion to get a closer look. We equipped the vessel with four miniaturized versions of the Resonant Eye, ones that one act in harmony to develop more detailed data from a closer range. We figured there would be some sort of unforeseen roadblock, but we didn’t expect one quite so literal. With the Veil obstructing us, I suppose we can just go through with investigating the other celestial bodies. The Divine Moon of Lo’Dahr is up first.
