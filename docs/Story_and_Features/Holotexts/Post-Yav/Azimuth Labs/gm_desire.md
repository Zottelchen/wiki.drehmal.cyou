## Transcription
> Emperor Anyr has confided in us one of his truest desires. He requested we pull as many records from the Avsohmic Archives as possible relating to the first emperor, Drehn Mal’Sohm. To this day Drehn is regarded as the best leader this realm has ever seen, period. God Emperor Anyr’s feelings toward him appear to be a mix of jealousy and idolship. He wishes to think more like Drehn. He wishes to be more like Drehn. He wishes to be better than Drehn. Reading about him can only get Lord Anyr so far, and now he wishes to ascend higher. With this, he shall be better than Drehn.
