> It has gone by many names. The Project. The Divinity Engine. The Catalyst of Ascension. The Spherewalker. Apotheosis. Admittedly it is all of those things. But at its base form, it is simply a machine that turns one into a god. There is no more apt name for it than the **God Machine**. It is the greatest creation of the Red Dawn Society. Our very own Great Work. Ready to be used and completed. We have reached the lofty goals of every alchemist before us. It is nearly time.
