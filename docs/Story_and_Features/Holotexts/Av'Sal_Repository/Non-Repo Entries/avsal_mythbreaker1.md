Found in the back room of the [[Av'Sal Repository]], alongside the hilt of the [[Mythbreaker]]. This holotext, alongside [[avsal_mythbreaker2.md|the other found in this room]], establishes the early-game goal of assembling the Mythbreaker by finding its separate parts throughout the world.

> Right behind me is the pinnacle of Avsohmic weapons technology. Well, the **hilt of it**, at least. Currently, the other **pieces** are being kept separate in **secure R&D locations**. Kahmas insisted that they be separate until we can effectively charge it, says it’s too dangerous if someone managed to steal or attempt to use it improperly. We have such good security I don’t think that’s much of a risk, but it’s his project so he calls the shots.
