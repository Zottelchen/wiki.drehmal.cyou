## Transcription
> Ahdul and the Emperor have been very insistent on using the core to charge the **Mythbreaker**. Power grid managers have told me the existing network on Drehmal wouldn’t be able to **handle the amount of energy required**. I mean, I trust them, but I worry about our ability to set up a powerful enough energy grid here on Lo’Dahr, and then connect it to the Terminus. Good thing that’s not my job!
