## Transcription
> They’re finally calling off the construction project. I managed to convince them that the risk of **tapping directly into Khive’s source of magic** is far too high. The second we **draw energy from the core**, Khive would know of our entire operation and wipe out all the work we’ve done on Lo’Dahr.
