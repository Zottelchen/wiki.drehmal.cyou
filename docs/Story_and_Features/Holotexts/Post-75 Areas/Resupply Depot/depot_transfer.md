> Alright, so—we’ve set up the transfer relay. In order to facilitate our growth on Lo’Dahr, we need energy. So, while we don’t have a reliable way to generate a lot of it, we’ll be leeching off of the Aphelion’s reactor. **Transfer is usually automatic**, but in the event of an orbital shift there’s an **override switch to the right** that will readjust our receiver. Flick the switch once the Aphelion hits its orbital apex above the facility every **75 seconds or so** to realign it. Once the receiver is realigned, energy should beam down again with each transit.
