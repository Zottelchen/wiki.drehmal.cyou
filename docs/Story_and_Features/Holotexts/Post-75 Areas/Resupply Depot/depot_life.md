> Lunar life is really nice! The work is pretty back-breaking, but the views we get from the Depot here are unforgettable. I’m hoping I can get a promotion to go work at the **Warp Ring Installation in Khive’s Domain**. I hear they’re doing some pretty important work that will facilitate further growth and expansion across the moon! I’m going to put in a tour request with the foreman here, maybe I can go check out the **Inscription Complex** too…
