> After initial expeditions to the Divine Moon, **Lord Anyr ordered a research station to be permanently established**. Before we could do anything else, we needed a logistics center. That’s where I came in! I was tasked to design a safe base of operations from which we could launch shipping aerocraft and receive incoming atmospheric landers from the Aphelion. And now with Vortu’s Terminus, one day we may be able to colonize the whole moon!
