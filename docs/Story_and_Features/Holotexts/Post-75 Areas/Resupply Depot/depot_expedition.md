> As C.O. of the Aphelion, I had to be among the first to make landfall on Lo’Dahr. We touched down here in **Rihelma’s Domain**, having to narrowly avoid the floating crystals and islands as I deftly maneuvered our lander. We didn’t stray too far from it, and until we were sure the atmospheric composition was breathable, we remained fully suited up. When I got the courage to remove my helmet, that first whiff of divine lunar air changed me forever. I never wanted to leave. But, the Aphelion needs me. Needs my command. **If we are to follow through with Anyr’s plan, they need me**.
