## Transcription
> The Glacial Elder’s divine ice has really done wonders for us. This form of ice crackles with the ambient magic here on Lo’Dahr, and has allowed us to really maximize catalyst inscription. Our **automated machines** generate a lot of heat, even back home on Drehmal with our best cooling tech we’d only be operating at 50% the efficiency we are now. There’s really something to be said for Aspect magics!
