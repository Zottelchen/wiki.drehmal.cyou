This holotext, found below the end of the conveyor belt in the [[Inscription Complex]], explains the purpose of the facility, as it was found that inscribed catalysts could not be safely transported via the Terminus.

## Transcription
> Rehntite is incredibly unstable when inscribed, which is why we store it on these levitation pads. When we first sent an inscribed catalyst through on of **Khive’s warp rings** the results were rather… explosive. Knocked out a whole wing of the **Ring Research Installation**. Sending inscribed catalysts through the Terminus at this stage would have a similar result. So, all rehntite catalysts used on Lo’Dahr are inscribed here.
