Found at the bottom of a staircase in the [[Ring Facility]], this holotext establishes that the Ring Research Installation was originally a hydroelectric power plant, but was converted to a research facility when it was discovered that the warp magic derived from the rings could transport energy to the moon from [[Overworld|Drehmal]].

> As soon as I flip this switch, hydroelectric power generation will cease! That was this facility’s original purpose, after all, as we had no practical way of piping primal energy off Drehmal and onto Lo’Dahr. As it turns out, we didn’t end up even needing to! With the discovery of the **Numencore**, we can draw all the primal energy we need locally and expand our enterprises here on the Divine Moon. As a power specialist, my job here is done. I’m now off to the **Core Facility** where my skills will continue to be used for the glory of Avsohm! Hail to Avsohm!
