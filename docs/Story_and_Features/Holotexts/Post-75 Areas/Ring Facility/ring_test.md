This holotext is found next to a ring in the [[Ring Facility]], which warps the player up to the surface of the facility. It establishes that active rings glow blue on their sides.

## Transcription
> There are hundreds of these rings all across Khive’s Domain, but only a handful seem to actually be active. We’ve discovered that by pumping energy into them, we can force an “active” state to be triggered. **When the sides glow blue, that means a ring is active**. What’s curious is that only one ring needs to be activated for its linked counterpart to also reach an active state. It seems that even when inactive, they’re always “communicating”. What’s also interesting is that when active, the indicators native to the rings take on an appearance and composition very similar to that of Rehntite.
