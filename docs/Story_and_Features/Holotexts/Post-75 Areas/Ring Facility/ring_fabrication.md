> Reverse-engineering the runes used for the magic on these rings was a real challenge, but a real fun one at that. We’re re-using the materials they’re made from locally because it’s easy, but in theory we could make new warp rings out of anything. I’ve begun to wonder what would happen if we were to use one of these rings on a **massive scale**, how much could we warp at once? And to what distance? I bet I could even figure out a way to where an initial receiving ring isn’t needed, and with that we could go **anywhere**.
