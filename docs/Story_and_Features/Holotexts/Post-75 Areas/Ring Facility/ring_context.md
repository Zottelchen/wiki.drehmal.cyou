> This whole non-observation thing is going to end up being annoying in the long run. So far we’ve managed to make it work by either closing our eyes during material transits, or by **walking backwards** through them when using the rings ourselves. The blueprints Arli received from Vortu looks promising though, albeit a little deranged. Hopefully whatever he’s come up with will work.
