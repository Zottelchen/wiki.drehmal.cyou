## Transcription
> We initially thought the amount of energy at the mountain was too miniscule to do anything withâ€¦ until we sent the drones to perform further analysis. It turned out to be far beyond our wildest dreams, a source of energy so immense that our empire would never want for anything. The construction of the **Primary Energy Collection Facility** may have resulted in the Frostfang Catastrophe and incredibly frigid northern temperatures, but in the end it was the best thing for our empire.
