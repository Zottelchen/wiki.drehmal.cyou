## Transcription
> Vehmil, Gohri, and I are working together on a contingency plan for any sort of **catastrophe** that would sweep Avsohm. We got permission from **Ahdul** to receive some Red Dawn assistance in animal experimentation before we actually start putting Drehmari in these pods. The goal is for these to be able to preserve us for **years** after a potential fall of Avsohm, and release us when the catastrophe has passed. Give the empire a second chance.
