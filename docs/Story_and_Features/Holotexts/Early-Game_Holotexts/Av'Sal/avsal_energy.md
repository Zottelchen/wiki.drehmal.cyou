> The preliminary **Avsohmic Energy Grid** is now complete. It directly connects all major military and research installations, as well as Av’Sal and Sal’Anyr, to the avSYS network. Now, energy transportation and communication are faster and easier than ever. Future plans include **expanding the Grid to all Avsohmic settlements**, but that will take some time.
