> … and as we close today’s gathering, I would like to make an announcement. Effective tomorrow I, **Drehn Mal’Sohm**, will no longer be your emperor. I am old now, and the heart beats only so many times. I have given my life to founding this great empire, and thus we have brought peace, prosperity, and unity across all of Drehmal. Now, I want for only two things. I would like to rest, and I would like to observe this empire to its very end. Alas, only the former may be a reality. I will gladly settle. Go forth, my children. Find your new emperor. May they lead you well. Hail to Avsohm.
