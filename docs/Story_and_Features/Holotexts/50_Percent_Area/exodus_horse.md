> Being part of Alchemical R&D in an arcane weapons storage/research facility is… interesting. The only space B.E. has for us is this tiny garage, despite how sprawling this whole facility is. **Kahmas** is kind to us when he visits, at least. Hopefully he’ll approve the **Warp Horse project** proposal, I’m really proud of my prototype! If approved, this will be the first application of **alchemically enhanced animals** being used in Avsohm’s arsenal!
