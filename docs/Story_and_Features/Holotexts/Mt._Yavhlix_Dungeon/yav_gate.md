## Transcription
> We received the transmission from inside. The door has been shut and the seal is placed, nothing can leave the mountain and nothing shall enter. We have lost communication with every other facility, so now we follow our protocols. We are to defend the door, defend the seal. **A powerful concentration of primal energy will shatter it, unleashing whatever lies inside**. We will not allow this. For any lingering personnel
still on this channel, know our purpose. Hail to Avsohm.
