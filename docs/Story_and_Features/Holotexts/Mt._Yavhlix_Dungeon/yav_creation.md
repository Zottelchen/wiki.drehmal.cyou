> The place may have cost [us] the <br>
North, but it has given us so, so <br>
much more. The drones found it, <br>
then we m[ar]ched. Catastrophe <br>
struck, and we persevered. Now we <br>
stand so, so tall. My family live like <br>
royalty, as do our neighbors and <br>
our neighborâ€™s neighbors. This <br>
facility is everything[. I]t is not <br>
m[erely] a facility, it is an anchor for <br>
ou[r c]ivilization[.] A piece of art, the <br>
center of our culture. Avsoh[m] is <br>
nothing without Mt. Yavhlix.
