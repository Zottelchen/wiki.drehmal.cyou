## Transcription
> If what my ever-so-faithful Orix says is true, we must find a way to save our realm from the slow, creeping enemy that **threatens its destruction**. If it means I must rule eternally over an empire built to stop its advance, then I will gladly bear that burden. Hail to Avsohm, and may the will of **Drehn Malâ€™Sohm** guide my blade.
