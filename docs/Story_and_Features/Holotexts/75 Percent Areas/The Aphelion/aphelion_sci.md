> Somehow, the **Aspects** are able to teleport to and from Lo’Dahr seemingly at will. Ihari thinks that the **ginormous energy signal we detected** is responsible. She theorizes that it **lies deep underground**, and the survey drones we’ve sent out seem to agree. **Digging doesn’t seem to be an option**, but I trust we’ll find some way to access it!
