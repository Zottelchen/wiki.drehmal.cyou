> The surface of the portal <br>
stretched like a babe clawing from <br>
its amniotic sac, and fro[m] it she <br>
emerged. She looked like us. She was <br>
made of tar. Her antlers drooped <br>
and dripped with the substance, two <br>
stark white eyes staring back at us. <br>
She had no mouth. When she moved <br>
her hands we heard her in our <br>
minds[: ]“He sees you. He is <br>
displeased. Leave before He takes <br>
you. Please leave.” <br>
That is all she said bef[or]e it <br>
became a mere puddle.
