# Mt. Yavhlix Dungeon Holotexts

!!! danger "This section contains moderate spoilers for the late/end-game dungeon at Mt. Yavhlix."

!!! danger "DO NOT read further if you have not completed this dungeon, at least to the "Once More Into the Breach" advancement."

This section contains the 11 holotexts found at the [[Primary Energy Collection Facility]] in [[Mt. Yavhlix]], a very late-game dungeon.

Holotexts in this area are often partially (or, in some cases, almost entirely) consumed by circular holes, making parts of them unreadable. In this wiki, the transcriptions for such holotexts contain some inferences as to the missing words, denoted in [square brackets]. Where there is not enough context to infer (as is the case in large holes), question marks (?) are used instead.
