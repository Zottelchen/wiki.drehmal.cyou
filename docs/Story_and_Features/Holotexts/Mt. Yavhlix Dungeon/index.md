This section contains the 11 holotexts found at the [[Primary Energy Collection Facility]] in [[Mt. Yavhlix]], a very late-game dungeon.

Holotexts in this area are often partially (or, in some cases, almost entirely) consumed by circular holes, making parts of them unreadable. However, by removing their alpha layers in a photo editor, the full texts can be made visible.

In this wiki, the original images (with holes) will be used, but their transcriptions will be made from the complete versions of the text. In those transcriptions, [square brackets] denote obscured text.
