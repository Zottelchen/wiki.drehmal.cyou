## Transcription
> It just… swallowed itself. I watched it from behind the corner, its mouth turned inside-out and it consumed itself. The sight turned my stomach, and what little I had for lunch is now spilled on the floor.
>
> I’m trapped. The seal is in place, and it cannot open from the inside. I have no clue if others survived, and I don’t know how long supplies will keep me alive here… suppose I shouldn’t let my lunch go to waste.
