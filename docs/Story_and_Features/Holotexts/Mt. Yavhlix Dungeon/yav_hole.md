!!! danger "This section contains moderate spoilers for the late/end-game dungeon at Mt. Yavhlix."

!!! danger "DO NOT read further if you have not completed this dungeon, at least to the "Once More Into the Breach" advancement."

This holotext can be found at the eastern end of the dungeon, and is almost entirely consumed by a massive hole in its center, making it mostly unreadable.

Let the realms collapse into unnumerable possibilities! He whispers! He whispers! He whispers! He whispers! He whispers! He whispers!
