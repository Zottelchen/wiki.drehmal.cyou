> Curse [th]at blasphemed em[peror!       ] <br>
Curse his obsession! Curse [his] <br>
mani[a! C]urse his child! Curse his <br>
enti[re b]lasted empire! If I was right <br>
in the mind I would have mutilated his <br>
beloved Eye, destroyed the thing <br>
that gave him i[nsigh]t to what lies <br>
beyond. Drehn was right to hesitate <br>
at [co]nquering this damned mountain. <br>
[We nev]er shoul[d h]ave interfered <br>
[with th]ese po[wers f]or they are far <br>
beyond what [we can ]comprehend. My <br>
beloved [emp]eror never woul[d] h[ave] <br>
allowed any of this.                        [    ]
