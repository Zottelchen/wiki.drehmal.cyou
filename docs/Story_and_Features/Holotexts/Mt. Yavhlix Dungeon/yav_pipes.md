> The channeling crystal at the top <br>
of the facility has been doing good <br>
wo[rk,] but subsurface fractures <br>
are interfering with efficiency and <br>
energy stability. Volatility meters <br>
are fluctuating rapidly, we’re <br>
thinking that the pipes just ne[ed] to <br>
be reinforced. The amount of [ raw] <br>
energy we’re pumping from the[  ] <br>
an[omaly] is frankly absurd - I’m not <br>
sur[e if] our current infrastructure <br>
can keep up.
