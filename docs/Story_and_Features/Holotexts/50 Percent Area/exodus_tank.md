> Hey, uh, if you’re reading this… **please stay away from the tank we have attached to the arm**. Somebody, uh, scratched the firing catalyst with a wrench pretty badly. Messed up a few runes. Now, uh, if you start it up… the charging sequence… starts. Let it run too long and it’ll uh, **fire**. A blast down here would be… bad. I left the keyfob **in one of the garages**, maybe one of the technicians will have time to fix it.
