> I got sent to this dank, submerged place to perform a check on its electrical systems. Apparently they’ve had some issues with **arc leaks** and minor blackouts, and arc leaks are the LAST thing you want in an underwater facility! I’ve gotta be here for a week, and all they have to eat are freeze dried Exodus Rations - not a single fresh vegetable in sight! I’m gonna put in a complaint with Indukahs, maybe bring it all the way up the chain to **Kahmas** if I have to.
