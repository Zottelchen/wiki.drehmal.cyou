> **Drehn Mal’sohm** came from a background of nobility, heir to the Chosen Throne. He was an absolutely brilliant diplomat, but didn’t have much of a penchant for conflict. **Emperor Anyr** was a general in Avsohm’s government, chosen by the people in a time when a strategist as skilled as him was in dire need. In my time as the leader of Blue Exodus, I’ve taken many cues from both of them. They’re not so dissimilar as one might first imagine.
