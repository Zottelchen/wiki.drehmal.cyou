## Transcription
> Simulations run on the blueprints extrapolated from the Eye have **failed to find an upper limit** in Mythbreaker’s theoretical energy capacity. Either our simulations are bugging, or this weapon is **truly ultimate**. Attempting to connect it into the energy grid for charging carries too great a risk. There’s a nonzero chance that the weapon could drain our entire energy grid and sever our connection to the **source**. We need an alternate solution.
