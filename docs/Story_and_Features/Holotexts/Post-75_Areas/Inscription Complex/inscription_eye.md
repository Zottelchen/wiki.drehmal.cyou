> From one frigid place to another, I suppose. It’s a good thing I was built for the cold! Previously I managed inscription logistics in and out of **Mt. Yavhlix**. I was scarcely able to seek the warm on the interior of the mountain, I had to be at the **door** confirming shipments. I suppose that’s why they picked me for the Aphelion crew, though. But then they stationed me here! In the cold again! Ugh. Hail to Avsohm.
