> While the Aspects don’t seem to mind our presence here all that much, their people do. Although we largely made peace with the Tehrmari of **Loeturia**, the younger folks have taken to a habit of hurling stones at our convoys. We need to transport catalysts safely from this facility to the **other three**, and one well-placed stone on a catalyst could mean losing an entire truckfull. I’m going to see if we can mediate with Loeturia’s elders, maybe strike some sort of deal.
