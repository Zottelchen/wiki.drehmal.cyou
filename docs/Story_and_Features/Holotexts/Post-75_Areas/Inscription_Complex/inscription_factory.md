## Transcription
> Automated catalyst inscription is wonderful but it requires a lot of upkeep. Every few hundred catalysts or so we need to **replace** our diamond lensing source in order to properly refract the inscribing lasers. **A cubic meter of diamond** is a lot heavier than it might sound! The machinery slowly breaks it down, introducing dust to the refraction chamber which creates a controllable matrix for inscribing any rune in our library.
