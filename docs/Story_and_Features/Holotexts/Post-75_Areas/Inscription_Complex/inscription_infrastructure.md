## Transcription
> Nearly everything we do here on Loâ€™Dahr is for the purpose of harnessing the **Numencore**. Inscription provides us with catalysts for powering technologies across our facilities. The **Spaceport** is for shipment of essential goods, personnel, and energy transfer from the main network on Drehmal. The **Warp Ring Installation** is what has allowed us to expand the Terminus and increase our capacity for energy flow. All of this, to harness another source of **Primal Energy**.
