## Transcription
> The galley rarely ever receives messages, especially not heavily encrypted ones originating from the Aphelion. Asked my inscriptor buddy Symis over in fabrication to decode it for me, and keep it on the down-low. The message is as follows: “Dear Ring Kitchen, if you happened to receive any fresh vegetables in your latest shipment of rations from **the Depot** please set some aside for return to the Aphelion. Please. I miss fresh vegetables. Verpyne keeps denying my requests. You’re my only hope.”
>
> Damn it, Vortu.
