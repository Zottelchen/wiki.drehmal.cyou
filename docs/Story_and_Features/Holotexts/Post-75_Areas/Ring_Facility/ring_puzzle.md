> Thereâ€™s something that still puzzles us about these rings. In order for warp transit to occur, the ring **must not be observed**. This took us a frankly embarrassingly long time to figure out, and once we did it only left us with more questions. Why must the rings function this way? Is it some sort of security mechanism? Were they designed expressly for the blind? Was Khive merely experimenting with observational mechanics? I suppose the only way to find out would be by asking the Mystic Elder himself.
