> The fine folks up top have decided we need a better way of getting catalysts here than direct importation from Drehmal - which is understandably expensive. **They’ve decided the best place to do so is in the snowy domain of Loe**. Something about cooling? Personally, I would rather they didn’t. We’re already dealing with the locals not taking kindly to our presence, and having to get through that snow is… difficult. Maybe we could do aerial shipping for the materials? This is giving me a headache.
