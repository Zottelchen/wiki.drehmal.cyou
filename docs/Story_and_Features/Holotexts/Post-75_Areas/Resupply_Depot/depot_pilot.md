> As one of the best pilots in Blue Exodus’ aerocraft division, it only made sense for me to come to Lo’Dahr. I must say, the vistas here are… absolutely stunning. There’s nothing like it on Drehmal. To soar amongst the gods themselves… truly a privilege. It makes one feel like a god themself. I was on patrol over the Star-Rise directly South, I peered out my left flank and saw her. The Star-Rise Drake herself, wings outstretched and swirling with galactic opulence. I uh, also stopped paying attention to my altitude and crashed. So much for being an “ace pilot.” Worth it, though.
