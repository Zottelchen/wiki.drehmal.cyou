## Transcription
> I’m happy to be able to contribute to the **Aphelion** in some way, even back here on the mainland. These wings, Avsohm’Kohl, should aid the crew rather greatly in traversal on their expeditions. I think I’ll ship some prototypes to Sal’Anyr as well; the Kohlohmah riders would surely appreciate the inspiration I took from their mounts in designing this new tech.
