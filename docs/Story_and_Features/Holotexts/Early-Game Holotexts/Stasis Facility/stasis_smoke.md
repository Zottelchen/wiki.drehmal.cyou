> You know what doesnâ€™t mix well? Limited oxygen supply and fire. Being underground, if a **fire** started and consumed our oxygen we would quickly find ourselves in a pretty awful situation. I set up these smoke detectors so that the sprinklers will trigger and the **holodoor will open** temporarily to increase ventilation.
