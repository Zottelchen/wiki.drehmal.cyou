> Vehmil: This is very, very bad. <br>
> Gohri: What is happening?! <br>
> Thresa: Stay calm. Get everyone that’s here into their pods. We prepared for this. <br>
> Gohri: They were supposed to tell us when it was going to begin! <br>
> Vehmil: This wasn’t planned. They would have told us. This seems… reactionary. <br>
> Thresa: We don’t know what’s happening, but we do know that the **energy grid is down**. All we can do is go through with stasis.
