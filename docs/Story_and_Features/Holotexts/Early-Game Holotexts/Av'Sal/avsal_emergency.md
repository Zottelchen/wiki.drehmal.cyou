This holotext is found along the top ring of the domed building in [[Av'Sal]]'s central island. It reports that the Avsohmic energy network has seen outages, and speculates on what may have caused that, pointing towards the [[Primary Energy Collection Facility]].

> The last thirty minutes have seen rolling blackouts across the entire energy network, as if something is overdrawing and our infrastructure can’t keep up. Early reports coming out of **Primary Energy Collection** are showing issues with the anomaly stabilizers. Maybe something is up with the **Ever-Fear**? We’re awaiting a status report from C.O.O. Orix on that front. It could of course be something entirely different, but I have my suspicions.
