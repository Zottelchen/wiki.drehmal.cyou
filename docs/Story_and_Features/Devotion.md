> Drehmal's Devotion Altar

Devotion is a mechanic unique to Drehmal that allows players to earn powerful offhand items called [relics[Relics]], as well as other rewards, by depositing specific items at specific altars. Each Major Aspect and deity has their own altar in a different location on the map.

There is a set of items that each Aspect/deity accept as offerings, each one having one of three different values. Lower-value items produce the message "*...*" in chat when offered, medium-value ones prompt the message "*...*" and higher-value ones make the message "*...*" appear. Every offering increases the player's "devotion" to the Aspect/deity that the altar is dedicated to.

The player receives experience points for every offering. Every 100 exp. worth of offerings increases the player's devotion level by one, and they will be gifted certain items depending on the level. Among these rewards are 4 different levels (separate items) of a relic, each level scaling the magnitude of its effects. The first level of the relic is the first reward, and the fourth one is the final reward. 

Some of the offerings accepted by an Aspect/deity can be found laying in invisible item frames in the area surrounding their altar. In the case of the deities, offerings can also be found in invisible item frames at their statues. Every Aspect's altar has a book nearby that hints at an item that is valued greatly
by them.

## Devotion Books

Near every Aspect's devotion altar is a book (not a book and quill or written book, its writing is in its description) that gives clues to help the player figure out one of the offerings that will increase their devotion greatly.

## [[Ytaj]] Altars (75% SPOIlERS)

In addition to their altars on [Drehmal[Drehmal (Place)]], each Aspect/deity has a secondary altar in their designated area within [[Ytaj]] on [[Lo'Dahr]]. These altars are functionally exactly the same as their overworld counterparts, and devotion progress is global.

## Benefactor Zabuyah (75% SPOILERS)

Benefactor Zabuyah is a trader that can be found in the right wing of Ytaj. They sell a wide range of chests (12 amethyst shards for one), each with a book inside hinting to the location of an Aspect/deity's altar on Drehmal.
