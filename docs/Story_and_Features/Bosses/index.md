# Bosses

Drehmal contains multiple custom bosses and minibosses, some of which can be found throughout the open world, and some of which are fought only in late-game story sections.

!!! warning "In this wiki, the end-game story bosses are confined to the "Endgame Story" folder. We STRONGLY advise AGAINST opening this folder if you have not finished the game, as seeing the number of bosses in this folder and their names alone may be considered a massive spoiler."

For the purposes of this wiki, **Bosses** are custom enemies with a health bar that appears at the top of the screen when fought. Some can be found in the open world as optional challenges, but others are only reached through story progression into the end-game.

**[Minibosses](/Story_and_Features/Bosses/Minibosses/)**, on the other hand, are simply named entities that do not have a health bar, but who are much stronger than normal enemies or have an encounter centered around them.
