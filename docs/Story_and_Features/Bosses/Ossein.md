# Skull Disciple Ossein

--8<-- "spoiler.md"

!!! warning "This article is about a boss that can be found naturally in the open world, at any time. If you would like to discover this encounter for yourself, do not continue reading this article."

**Skull Disciple Ossein**, or simply **Ossein** (pronounced OH-sayn), is a boss located in the [[South Heartwood]].

Found at the epicenter of Mael's Desolation (also called the [[Rock Maw]]), Ossein is an open-world boss, meaning that he can be fought at any time once discovered. Players need only press a button in the center of the arena to summon him.

Ossein is a custom skeleton mob, armed with [[Calamity]] and riding a skeleton horse. He has a wide array of magical attacks, including the ability of Calamity, True Catastrophe. 

Defeating Ossein gives a player the [[Calamity]] mythical weapon.

## Location

Ossein's arena is not technically within the normal bounds of the map. Rather, it is a copy of the Epicenter of the Desolation, located in the Dev Zone far to the east of the main continent, which players are teleported to when they begin the fight.

The fight must be initiated from the real Epicenter, located in the western half of the [[South Heartwood]] at approximately **(1030, 60, 3830)**.

> The shrine where Ossein's fight is initiated.

Players will come to the shrine pictured above, with the message "A calamitous energy radiates from the shrine..." displaying upon approach. Pressing the black button on the obsidian block will teleport players to the true arena, "summoning" Ossein.

## Fight

After a few seconds, Ossein will appear in the center of the arena, riding a skeleton horse. While on horseback, Ossein will utilize exclusively ranged attacks, shooting at the player with a Power 20-enchanted bow and blindness-tipped arrows. Ossein's is also capable of spawning wither skull projectiles, telegraphed by a small ring of particles over the ground, where groups of 3-4 will appear. The horse can be killed relatively easily, as it has only 40 health.

Like all bosses, Ossein's health scales based on the number of players configured in the `/trigger Settings` menu.

| **Players** | **Health** |
|:-----------:|:----------:|
| 1 | 225 |
| 2-3 | 265 |
| 4-5 | 320 |
| 6-7 | 455 |
| 8+ | 560 |

Once Ossein's horse is dead, he becomes much more mobile and dangerous, wielding a base movement speed of 0.42 (over 4x faster than the player's walk speed). On foot, he will continue shooting at the player with his bow and wither skull projectiles, but can also switch to Calamity. When the item in Ossein's right hand switches to the claw, players have about a second to get out of the range of his True Catastrophe attack, in which he will rise straight up and slam into the ground, dealing damage to anything within about 10-15 blocks of his landing point.

Defeating Ossein is heavily reliant on either the ability to evade his attacks, coming from high movement speed, or extremely high damage output to kill him quickly.

When killed, Ossein will drop [[Calamity]] and his skull, a player head which can be used for decorative purposes. Players may then return to the main map by pressing the "EXIT" button on the shrine which appears in the center of the arena.

Ossein can only be killed once. If the button to start his fight is pressed again after defeating him, the player will simply be met with the message "The Skull Disciple rejects your call..." in chat.

## Lore

In life, Ossein appears to have been a regular [[Drehmari]] whose childhood home was ravaged by the [[Skullbeasts]] during one of [[Maelihs]]'s conquests of the West. Due to some combination of the trauma and his own predispositions, Ossein developed a macabre fascination with these monsters, developing to the point of infatuation with one in particular, named Femura.

As found in [[Disciple's Log|his own writing]], Ossein became versed in the rites of [[necromancy]], and eventually made a pilgrimage to the [[Birthing Grounds]], the former home of the [[Skullmother]] where she was used to create legions of Skullbeasts. He attempted a necromantic ritual to revive Femura, but was unable to even create a single Skullbeast. Dejected, Ossein stumbled across fragments of the Skullbeasts deep underground in the Birthing Grounds, presumably using them for some means.
