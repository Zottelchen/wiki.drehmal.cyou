**The Vehrniis** (pronounced "vurr-neese") is a massive sea serpent boss found in [[Challenger's Grotto]].

The Vehrniis can be fought at any time if the player reaches her arena, and defeating her rewards the player with the [[Proxigea]] legendary weapon. This is not one of the [six trials](/World/Post-75_Area/Points_of_Interest/Trials/) on the moon.

## Extras

### Origin and Name

The Vehrniis was built off of an armor stand "worm" experiment built by Numbers, Drehmal's lead coder in 2.2. She was given the nickname "Bernice" early in development, and this has persisted to this day as her most frequently used name in the community. The name "Vehrniis" was coined in order to make "Bernice" sound more like a name that could fit in the world of Drehmal.

### Soundtrack

The soundtrack for the Vehrniis' boss battle is "What Lurks Below", by Drehmal composer Chris Nesja.[^1]
