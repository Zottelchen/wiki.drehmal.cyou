**Tethlaen, Lost to Nothing** is a boss located in [[Nothing Island|The Nothing]], at the end of the [[Primary Energy Collection Facility|Mt. Yavhlix dungeon]]. This boss is the Aspect of Fear, [[Tethlaen]], who has been trapped in the Nothing and greatly weakened.

Tethlaen is a re-skin of the vanilla Ender Dragon with additional mechanics, which make the fight arguably the most difficult in the map. Tethlaen has a number of larger AoE attacks and projectile attacks, and also spawns large numbers of strong hostile mobs themed around fear, including Evokers, Ravagers, and more.

Mechanically, this fight plays out the same as the vanilla Ender Dragon, and Tethlaen's AI is very similar to that of the Ender Dragon. He will fly around the arena, being healed by end crystals atop tall obsidian pillars. Additionally, there are three stone towers around the island which contain a very strong enemy and another end crystal. These towers represent the Avsohmic healing structures.
