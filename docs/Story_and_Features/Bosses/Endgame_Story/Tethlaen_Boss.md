**Tethlaen, Lost to Nothing** is a boss located in [[Nothing Island|The Nothing]], at the end of the [[Primary Energy Collection Facility|Mt. Yavhlix dungeon]]. This boss is the Aspect of Fear, [[Tethlaen]], who has been trapped in the Nothing and greatly weakened.

Tethlaen is a re-skin of the vanilla Ender Dragon with additional mechanics, which make the fight arguably the most difficult in the map for builds without high armor or other means of defense. 

Tethlaen has a number of larger AoE attacks and projectile attacks, and also spawns large numbers of strong hostile mobs themed around fear, including Evokers, Ravagers, and more.

## Location

Tethlaen's arena is an [[Nothing Island|island in the Nothing]], accessed by finding the three levers in the [[Primary Energy Collection Facility]] and activating the end portal with 12 Oculi of Nothing. 

## Fight

It is not clear if Tethlaen's health scales with player count like other bosses.

Mechanically, this fight plays out the same as the vanilla Ender Dragon, and Tethlaen's AI is very similar to that of the Ender Dragon. He will fly around the arena, being healed by end crystals atop tall obsidian pillars. Additionally, there are three stone towers around the island which contain a very strong enemy and another end crystal, which must be towered to and broken into.

Stone towers to the north and southeast each hold a Zealot of Nothing, the only appearance of the Illusioner mobs in Drehmal. The tower to the southwest holds a Lost Avsohmic Commander, a very strong celestial armor-clad wither skeleton which is also found in the Primary Energy Collection Facility.

Tethlaen's additional attacks include a volley of tridents, which can be incredibly difficult to dodge and more projectile beams that can hit from long distance.

As his health is whittled down, Tethlaen will begin to summon additional, progressively more dangerous mobs, all themed around fear, which will also assault the player. These mobs' health and attack damage do scale with player count, and include:

| **Mob Name** | **Base Mob** | **Notes** | **Health Threshold** |
|:------------:|:------------:|:----------:|:-------------------:|
| Intrusive Thought | Endermite | | 90% |
| Fevered Vision | Stray | Wields a celestial sword. | 90% |
| Creeping Doubt | Stray | Ranged, wears a custom player head that resembles a purple hooded figure, similar to the Twilight Envoy at the [[Augural Tangle]]. | 70% |
| Waking Nightmare | Wither Skeleton | Very strong, similar to a Lost Avsohmic Commander. | 40% |
| Night Terror | Ravager | Custom-textured. | 20% |
| Midnight Intruder | Stray | Invisible, wields dual daggers similar to the Voidtear Assassins inside Mt. Yavhlix. | \*Unclear, potentially unused. |

On death, Tethlaen will drop a massive amount of experience and give a final few dialogue lines, then open the return portal. Entering this portal will play the (vanilla) Minecraft credits, after which the true end-game sequence begins.

## Lore

Tethlaen learned of and flew into the tear at Mt. Yavhlix in approximately Av 32, nearly 3000 years ago. Since that time, he has guarded the realm from the outside, holding the tear closed and preventing an excess of [[Primal Energy]] from leaking into Drehmal. However, the currents of Primal Energy and the mysterious void beasts began to wear even on a minor god, and Tethlaen nearly lost his mind before [[Avsohm]] discovered the tear and ventured into it around Av2 1700-1800. Avsohm erected the three stone towers found in the arena to help heal the Aspect's body, and in return, he allowed the empire to siphon some of the energy for their own use.

After the [[Fall of Avsohm]], however, Tethlaen was once again left to his own devices for over a thousand years. In that time, he has been greatly battered, to the point that he is barely able to string together short sentences and is weak enough for a single Drehmari to kill.
