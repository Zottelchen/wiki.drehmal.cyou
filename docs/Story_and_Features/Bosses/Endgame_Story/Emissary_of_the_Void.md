The **Emissary of the Void**, also referred to simply as **The Emissary** or **"The Pawn"**, is the final boss fight of Drehmal: Apotheosis.

Located at the end of the [[Maddened Path]], Drehmal's penultimate [story location](/Story_and_Features/Story_Locations/), the Emissary wields the largest set of attacks of any boss in the map. 

The Emissary appears as a [[Drehmari]] wearing a purple hood, and fights with a copy of the mythical scythe [[Oblivion]].

In the Emissary's second phase, his true identity is revealed as [[Drehn|Drehn Mal'Sohm]], the founding emperor of [[Avsohm]] and the scythe-wielding "Pawn" seen immediately before and during the [[Fall of Avsohm]].

Defeating the Emissary will open a portal to the final location in the story, the [[True End]].
