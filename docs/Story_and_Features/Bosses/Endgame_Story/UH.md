**[[Ultva]]** and **[[Hovadchear]]**, presented as **Ultva, Genocide of One** and **Hovadchear, Master of the Order**, are a two-part boss fought in the [[Court of Nothing]].

The fallen masters of [[Insohm]] brought underneath [[yellow|The Mythoclast]]'s wing, Ultva and Hovadchear make for a relatively straightforward boss battle. Each character wields a version of their own legendary weapon found in the map: Ultva uses [[Ultva's Bowblade]] and Hovadchear uses [[Hovadchear's Greathammer]].

In the first phase of the fight, only Ultva, the ranged attacker, can be damaged, as Hovadchear is surrounded by a magical shield. Once Ultva dies, Hovadchear "enters a primal rage" and becomes more aggressive, but is also susceptible to damage.

Defeating Hovadchear moves forward to the next part of the sequence, opening a portal to the [[Maddened Path]].
