# Ultva & Hovadchear

--8<-- "spoiler.md"

**[[Ultva]]** and **[[Hovadchear]]**, presented as **Ultva, Genocide of One** and **Hovadchear, Master of the Order**, are a two-part boss fought in the [[Court of Nothing]]. Defeating them leads to the [[Maddened Path]].

The fallen masters of [[Insohm]] brought underneath [[yellow|The Mythoclast]]'s wing, Ultva and Hovadchear make for a relatively straightforward boss battle. Each character wields a version of their own legendary weapon found in the map: Ultva uses [[Ultva's Bowblade]] and Hovadchear uses [[Hovadchear's Greathammer]].

## Location

Ultva & Hovadchear are a mandatory part of the end-game sequence, fought at the [[Court of Nothing]].

> The Court.

Their arena contains several large pillars, which players can use to create distance between themselves and the bosses.

## Fight

After ascending the staircase to the arena, Ultva & Hovadchear will appear after a large particle display in the center of the arena.

Like all bosses, Ultva & Hovadchear's health depends on the number of configured players in the `/trigger Settings` menu. Ultva's health increases up to 4-5 players, while Hovadchear's health and base attack damage both increase with every level of players.

| **Players** | **Ultva Health** | **Hovad Health** | **Hovad Base Attack Damage** |
|:-----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| 1 | 500 | 200 | 15 |
| 2-3 | 800 | 350 | 16 |
| 4-5 | 1000 | 500 | 17 |
| 6-7 | 1000 | 650 | 18 |
| 8+ | 1000 | 800 | 20 |

In the first phase of the fight, only Ultva, the ranged attacker, can be damaged, as Hovadchear is surrounded by a magical shield. Ultva will shoot at players regularly, occasionally charging up a heavy shot, indicated by white particles at his feet. This shot, if it lands, will freeze its target in place for a moment. Hovadchear deals damage on any successful melee attack, with a similarly potent charge attack of his own. This is indicated by red particles around his feet, which immediately precede a rapid dash at the player, which deals large amounts of damage if he makes contact with the player. The pillars can theoretically break up either of these charge attacks, but some players report that Hovad can skip around them at times.

Once Ultva dies, Hovadchear "enters a primal rage" and becomes more aggressive, but is also finally susceptible to damage. He has comparatively little health.

Defeating Hovadchear prompts further dialogue from the Mythoclast, who opens a portal to the [[Maddened Path]].

Each of these dual bosses drops their helmet (a custom player head) on death, as well as a piece of coal (likely owing to the fact that the actual mobs are Wither Skeletons).

If you find yourself struggling against this boss, you can simply leave through the entrance portal and return, despite the in-game dialogue marking this as a point of no return.

## Lore

The reason for Ultva and Hovadchear's ultimate fate as seen here is unclear, but it does seem to implicate the Mythoclast in the downfall of [[Insohm]], and the disappearance of [[Castle Hovadchear]] in particular.
