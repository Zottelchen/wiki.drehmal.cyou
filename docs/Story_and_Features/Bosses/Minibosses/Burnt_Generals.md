# Burnt Generals

The **Burnt Generals** are the highest-ranking officers under [[Maelihs]]. There are three Burnt Generals, all of whom appear in the map as [[Maelmari]] brute minibosses.

**Rhalon**, the First General, is located at the [[Coven of Potentia]].

**Tevus**, the Second General, guards the [[Burnt Palace]].

**Ethgar**, the Third General, patrols the [[Sepulchral Altar]] in [[Rhaveloth]].

## Rhalon

### Location

The First General is Rhalon (pronounced "raw-lawn"). She is located in the basement of the Insohmic [[Coven of Potentia]], a castle on the eastern coast of the [[Spearhead Forest]]'s Shattered Peninsula. Rhalon is somewhat notorious for jumpscaring players, as she appears in a flash of smoke as players approach the end of a room leading down to the lower level. She drops the [[Artifacts#Rhalon's Chestplate|Rhalon's Chestplate]] artifact on death, and her helmet.

### Lore

Rhalon was the leader of the Burnt Generals, and Mael's second-in-command prior to his departure. She is known as the greatest warrior in the Empire of Maelihs besides the Burnt Lord himself.

Rhalon also appears to be the most proactive of the Burnt Generals, spearheading the empire's efforts to find the [[Aphelion]].

## Tevus

### Location

Tevus is the Second General, and guards the most sacred place in Mael's empire: the [[Burnt Palace]]. Tevus appears in the staircase leading up to Mael's bedchamber in a similar (although slightly less violent) manner to Rhalon, upon a player's approach.

## Ethgar

### Location

Ethgar is the only Burnt General in the map who does not spawn in. Rather, they are located in [[Rhaveloth]], guarding the [[Sepulchral Altar]], and are present before the player arrives.

### Lore

Ethgar seems to be more active than Tevus, with firsthand accounts of them oppressing the surrounding lands in [[South Tharxax]]. The [[Artifacts#Sliming Trousers|Sliming Trousers]] found in [[Semehol]] recount a time that Ethgar's army brutally crushed a rebellion in that town, and their fiery personality is also attested to in [[Dahroc's Notes]], where they are the only one to outright question [[Maelihs]] after he released the [[Skullmother]].
