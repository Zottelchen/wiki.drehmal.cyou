# Minibosses

Minibosses in Drehmal are somewhat difficult to define. For the sake of this wiki, minibosses are typically named, humanoid enemies with large amounts of health and some degree of custom attacks/weaponry/spawning, but *without* a health bar. They do not typically present significant challenges, but are noteworthy for their lore relevance or spectacle.

These enemies are almost always renamed zombies or skeletons.

## Open-World

These minibosses are part of open-world structures, discoverable through exploration at any time.

### Abbot Balthysar

Abbot Balthysar is a [[Virmari]] miniboss who spawns at the top of [[Teiruun Monastery]]. The book that he drops is instrumental in uncovering the mystery of that location.

### Burnt Generals

The [[Burnt Generals]] are three [[Maelmari]] minibosses who serve as the highest-ranking officers under [[Maelihs]].

### Executive Unit

The Executive Unit is an enemy with a boss bar, in the final wave of the [[Foundry]] arena. Despite its boss bar, its inclusion in a larger combat encounter and relative ease to defeat led us to categorize it as a miniboss, rather than a true boss.

### Shatterhorn Warden

The Shatterhorn Warden is the warden of the prison at [[Shatterhorn Gulch]]. He respawns infinitely, but drops the [[Festering Strides]] legendary boots when killed for the first time.

### Twilight Envoy

The Twilight Envoy is a miniboss at the end of the [[Augural Tangle]], wielding ranged dagger attacks against the player. It guards the final lantern on the path to the [[Aeongale]] legendary.
