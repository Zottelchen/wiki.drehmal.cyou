# Glossary
Drehmal's resource pack renames several vanilla Minecraft items to make them better adhere to the map's lore. This page contains a list of item, block, and mob names, in both their usual Minecraft name and their Drehmal counterpart. 

!!! info "Advanced Tooltips"
    If you press the `F3` and `H` keys at the same time while in-game, you will activate **Advanced Tooltips**. This will tell you the exact Minecraft ID of whatever you're holding, which can help you understand what you're looking at if you don't recognize an item name, in addition to some other helpful info.

[^1]: Nether Gold Ore is not obtainable in the map, as the Nether is disabled. Nether Gold Ore is renamed to be the same as deepslate gold ore, but retains its vanilla texture if obtained via the `/give` command.
[^2]: This block is typically unobtainable, and should not theoretically ever be seen by the player.
[^3]: All dyed Runic Vessels also retain this name.
