# Smithed Summit 2024

The first **Smithed Summit** was an online convention in a custom Minecraft world hosted by [Smithed](https://smithed.net/) from November 2-9, 2024. This week-long event offered Minecraft map developers and coders to showcase their datapack-related creations. 

## Drehmal Booth

!!! warning "The Drehmal Summit booth featured some late-game content removed from its in-map context. These could be considered spoilers, so if you are sensitive to spoilers, you may not want to continue reading this article unless you have nearly beaten the map."

The Drehmal team was one of these vendors, building a booth to show off Drehmal's world and some of its tech. This booth took the form of a massive floating disc, highly reminiscent of the actual [[disc]] upon which [[Overworld|Drehmal]] lies. The top of the world was a diorama recreating the entirety of Drehmal's map, complete with miniature [[Terminus Network#Towers|Terminus towers]] which showed screenshots of their real in-map locations when right-clicked. Inside, smaller builds and [holotexts](/Story_and_Features/Holotexts/) were home to brief summaries of the map's lore and gameplay.

The booth also featured a "Hall of Mythicals", containing each of the eight [Mythical Weapons](/Items/Mythical_Weapons/), although their full abilities could not be used in the Summit world. Seven [[artifacts]] were hidden throughout the booth, six of which already existed in the map. These were:

- [[Artifacts#Axe of Growth|Axe of Growth]] <br>
- [[Artifacts#Talisman of Endless Growth|Talisman of Endless Growth]] <br>
- [[Artifacts#Wish for Hope|Wish for Hope]] <br>
- [[Artifacts#Harbormaster's Cap|Harbormaster's Cap]] <br>
- [[Artifacts#Continent Crusher|Continent Crusher]] <br>
- [[Artifacts#Whimsical Shortsword|Whimsical Shortsword]] <br>

A seventh artifact was hidden on the underside of the booth, at the end of a hidden parkour course. This artifact, the **Arbalest of Az'Radul**, does not exist in any known version of the Drehmal map. It is therefore unclear exactly how canon the artifact is.

|          |                |
| -------- | -------------- |
| **Base Item** | Crossbow |
| **Enchantments** | Piercing X <br> Infinity |
| **Bonus Stats (Off-Hand)** | +35% Movement Speed <br> Unbreakable |

**Lore Text:** *The royal citadel of Az'Radul finished construction shortly before the swarm. The Weeping One made her nest here, furling her clipped wings and resting her weary, scabbed-over stumps. As the people of the world below amount their last defense against her children, they feel her horrible sobbing quake the very earth around them. Perhaps, she chose this roost to remind her of a forgotten home, a place to sleep above the deep sea of stars. And when she dreams, if she dreams at all, it is of a gift for those that brought her torment. A gift of rage. A gift of ruin.*

A miniature version of [[Vehrniis|The Vehrniis]] is found swimming around the edge of the diorama, doing laps around the continent.

A fully modeled [[Maelihs]] rests on a throne in the lower levels of the booth, and can be spoken to. Mael offers a basic introduction of the realm's history and setting to new prospective players, but does not really have any new content for returning players.

??? quote "Smithed Summit Mael Dialogue"
    Greetings, realmwalker. <br>
    I have been asked by Him to answer any questions you may have about my home. <br>
    You may read an excerpt of my realm's origins on the tablet to your left. <br>
    [Player] Who are you? <br> 
    I am Maelihs, known as the "Burnt God of Chaos, Corruption and Conflict" within Drehmal. <br>
    [Player] That sounds... pretty evil. <br>
    Indeed. <br>
    [Player] Cool. <br>
    If you have questions about my realm, I am here to answer. <br>
    [Player] Tell me about yourself. <br>
    There is not much to say. Once upon a time, I acted as my title would have you expect. <br>
    Razing the countryside, maiming and torturing those who opposed me, causing countless wars and the like. <br>
    I created a people to do my bidding, just as my sister did out of the land's common-folk. <br>
    From my seat of power in the Burnt Palace to the Southwest, I sought complete realm-wide domination. <br>
    Times are changing, though. <br>
    [Player] The Burnt Palace? <br>
    My home. It lies within a great caldera on the Southwest peninsula of the realm, guarded by a maze-like canyon and scalding waters that make landing on its shores impossible. <br>
    These days, I do not reside there often. You can see it for yourself, if you go and explore the diorama up top. <br>
    [Player] Let's talk about something else. <br>
    [Player] Your sister? <br>
    The "Goddess of Peace, Purity and Perfection" -- Virtuo. <br>
    She was born opposite myself in the Felling, unmarred and pristine. <br>
    One of her first acts in the reformed world was to take some common-folk, the Drehmari, and twist them into her beloved Virmari. <br>
    I, in turn, took both her Virmari and the realm's Drehmari to create a people of my own. We then fought for a long, long time. <br>
    [Player] Why did you fight? <br>
    Envy begets jealousy, realmwalker. If you leave this conversation with nothing else, let it be that. <br>
    [Player] Why isn't she here? <br>
    Her departure marked the beginning of the current era, the Fourth Avihm. <br>
    She took her closest and most beloved Virmari, and forsook the rest. <br>
    Without their goddess, most Virmari have lost their luster. <br>
    As for where she went, I have my suspicions. <br>
    But those are not for me to share. <br>
    [Player] Let's talk about something else. <br>
    [Player] What is it like on Drehmal? <br>
    For all of its strife, it is truly a beautiful place. <br>
    From the autumnal forests of Merijool to Akhlo'Rohma's giant flowers and vibrantly colored cliffsides, the volcanic Black Jungle and its cherry-blossomed island of Sahd.
    The remnants of the Empire of Avsohm dot the land, as their dominion once spread across nearly the entire continent. <br>
    [Player] What was the Empire of Avsohm? <br>
    Their tale is one of boundless ambition and horrific calamity. <br>
    They once united the major kingdoms of the realm, under one rule and one flag. <br>
    They accessed forbidden energy, and became incredibly technologically advanced. <br>
    Then one day, calamity struck. The entire empire collapsed, its leadership and military disappearing without a trace. <br>
    I took that opportunity to seize control of the West, as they had managed to contain my armies to the red-desert of the Carmine. <br>
    Perhaps if you were to visit my realm proper, you could find out more about them. Maybe you'll uncover secrets even I am not privy to. <br>
    [Player] Let's talk about something else. <br>
    [Player] Who lives on Drehmal? <br>
    Drehmal is largely made up of the Drehmari. A resilient, antlered people born of the Primal Tree. <br>
    There are far fewer of them now than there once were. Drehmal has fallen far from its Golden Age when the Avsohmic Empire once ruled. <br>
    The realm never recovered from the Empire's collapse hundreds of years ago. <br>
    These days, many Drehmari know all too much about hunger and poverty. <br>
    Trade flows at a snail's pace, and even then goods are scarce to go around. <br>
    To thrive is a concept of the past for them, now they simply do their best to survive. <br>
    [Player] I'll be going now. <br>
    Safe travels, Realmwalker. May we meet again when your soul settles.
