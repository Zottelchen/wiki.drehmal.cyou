# DLC

Drehmal does not, at this time, have any official expansions made by the entire developer team. 

However, there is a modpack and modified world which is colloquially known as the **"DLC"**. This modded version of the world, created by developer tworoundcats (before being promoted to the dev team), can be found at [this page on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpack/drehmal-apotheosis-2.2-dlc).

The DLC is NOT an official expansion, but is still well-known within the Drehmal community. It is NOT recommended for first-time players due to the non-canon lore it adds, but it can be a very enjoyable way to give the map replay value for players looking to return to the world of Drehmal.

## Content

Unfortunately, due to the scope of the DLC and the fact that no wiki curators have played it, DLC content does not appear on this wiki outside of the summary on this page. If you need help with the setup or gameplay of the DLC, check the Modrinth page for the installation video and the documentation directly from the developer.

The DLC adds several new modded gameplay mechanics, including the Better Combat mod, a new enchanting system, trinket and ring slots, new modded currencies, backpacks, and tougher versions of open-field vanilla enemies. The DLC also adds new Mythical and Legendary gear in accordance with Drehmal's conventions, as well as a new, separate system for upgrading mythical weapons. Some villagers also serve as proper NPCs, giving the player explicit quests through dialogue.
