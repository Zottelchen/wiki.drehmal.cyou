Since the publishing of [[Drehmal v2]], there has been interest in speedrunning the map, with several different categories which have evolved with the map's growth over time. Routing, speedrun discussion, and record-keeping is almost exclusively contained to the completion-locked #speedruns channel in the [[Socials#Discord|Discord server]].

This page will not go into detail regarding any individual runs, but will summarize some of the methods utilized by speedrunners, as well as the most prominent categories.

## Common Tactics

Beginning in the late summer of 2024, the meta form of movement for any of the longer speedruns became [[Artifacts#Sharksbane|Sharksbane]] bowboosting. By shooting oneself with Sharksbane, an artifact bow enchanted with Punch IV, players are able to achieve high speeds when gliding with [[Avsohm'Kohl]], far quicker than traveling on horseback or gliding normally.

The [[Stasis Bolt]] has also seen use in speedrunning, as players have discovered that shooting oneself with a stasis bolt can cause the velocity of thrown projectiles to greatly increase while frozen. This means that when a player is shot with a stasis bolt, they can throw ender pearls over incredibly long distances (several hundred blocks).

## Categories

In Drehmal 2.2, there are a few prominent categories, with criteria set by the speedrunning community. Current records can be found in a pinned message in the #speedruns channel of the Discord.

### Any%

Like any other any% category, this run has one goal: reach the end of the game (the final credits room), using any means provided to you in the map. This has been done in as little as 5 minutes and 42 seconds using exploits left in the out-of-bounds developer zone.

Older Any% records made use of the fact that the future version of [[Sal'Mevir]] and the [[True End]] are located in the same dimension. In these runs, players found creative ways to cancel the timer that automatically teleports you back to the regular Sal'Mevir, then proceeding to glide or climb over the gap to the area where the credits can be triggered. This method resulted in finishes as fast as 13:55.

### Any% Glitchless

Any% Glitchless is a version of the run which does not utilize any glitches. The current 2.2 Glitchless world record is held by novadud, at 55 minutes and 30 seconds.

### No Major Glitches (NMG)

NMG permits some more minor glitches, but not those deemed to be "major" - primarily clipping out of bounds or skipping through the True End. The record for this category is held by novadud at 42 minutes, 36 seconds.

### 100%

100% is a hypothetical speedrun, not yet attempted in 2.2, which would entail reaching 100% advancements in the post-credits room. This does not include the hidden advancements which are untracked by that button (although the hypothetical 106% run is a true all advancements run).
