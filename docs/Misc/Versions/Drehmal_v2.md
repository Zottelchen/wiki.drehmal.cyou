# v2: PRIMΩRDIAL

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Drehmal v2: PRIMΩRDIAL** (also referred to simply as v2 or 2.0) was the first major update to the Drehmal Minecraft map, released on March 31, 2020 for Minecraft: Java Edition 1.15.2.

Featuring fully re-imagined terrain on a larger, 12k by 12k grid, the landscape of Drehmal v2 is nearly identical to the current version. The lone exception to this is the rework of the northeastern regions which was done in 2.2.

This version also introduced the foundations of the current Drehmal experience, including the main story that revolves around the [[Avsohm|Empire of Avsohm]], rudimentary variants of custom [Legendary](/Items/Legendary_Items/) and [Mythical](/Items/Mythical_Weapons/) gear, the vast majority of the realm's [official towns](/World/Settlements/Official_Towns/), and more.

2.0 also tweaked the class system, allowing players to select one of three pairs of boots, which could be upgraded to higher tiers for increasing stat bonuses.

## How to Play

The original MediaFire upload of the March 2020 version of Drehmal v2.0 does still exist, at [this link](https://www.mediafire.com/file/8u9h6a3xrme84nj/Drehmal_v2_PRIM%25CE%25A9RDIAL.zip/file). The only required mod for this version of Drehmal is [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/downloads) for 1.15.2. The resource pack is built into this version of Drehmal, so you can simply put the world into your saves folder, load a 1.15.2 OptiFine instance, and play the map.

## Story Progression

Drehmal v2.0 strictly follows the tower-linked method of story progression, in which activating fast travel towers leads to the unlocking of story event milestones at 50%, 75%, and 100% network linkage. Unlike 2.2, 100% tower linkage is required to enter the end-game dungeon at [[Mt. Yavhlix]], by activating the "Mythbreaker Protocols" outside of the facility's door.
