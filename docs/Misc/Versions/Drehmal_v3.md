**Drehmal v3** was a version of Drehmal released on April 1, 2021, as an April Fools' joke. 

This version of the map contains several over-the-top joke items, intentionally absurd terrain, and developer/community in-jokes. It is mechanically very similar to [[Drehmal v21|Drehmal v2.1]], requiring 100% tower linkage to enter [[Mt. Yavhlix]] and complete the "story".

## Changes

There are many, many changes in Drehmal v3, including but not limited to:

- Major terrain features such as mountain ranges and island chains have been hastily, crudely remade with default WorldPainter brushes. <br>
- A clear smiley face is drawn in the terrain of western [[Casai]], referencing a terrain feature in base Drehmal v2 that some people have compared to a face. <br>
- The word "JUUL" is spelled out in the terrain of [[Merijool]]. <br>
- The [[Island of Dawn]] has been replaced by the Island of Lawn, a perfectly square island of bright green grass. <br>
- The Gay Desert in southern [[Anyr'Nogur]] has been turned into a Trans Desert, with hills drawing out the rough shape of a mitochondrion. <br>
- To make up for the loss of the Gay Desert, a miniature rainbow-ified version of the entire continent has been added to the far northern ocean. <br>
- A massive vehicle has been drawn over [[The Carmine]], with several abandoned cars littering the region. <br>
- The [[Hellcrags]] have been turned into the "Wellcrags", a lush and peaceful tropical paradise. <br>
- The [[North Heartwood]] has been replaced by vanilla forest terrain. <br>
- Several recursive outlines of the shape of Oklahoma have been added to northeastern [[Akhlo'Rohma]] (a humorous misinterpretation of the region's name). <br>
- Loss has been added to [[Highfall Tundra]]. <br>
- The [[Verdant Labyrinth]] has been replaced with an actual maze. <br>
- The [[Kiln of Virtuo]] has been turned red and evil. <br>
- Several Among Us crewmates are drawn into the terrain, in various locations.
