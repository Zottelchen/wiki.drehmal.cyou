# Socials

There are several dedicated places where Drehmal discussion takes place.

## Discord

The official **Drehmal: Apotheosis Discord Server**, sometimes referred to as **Drehmalcord**, is a Discord server owned by the Drehmal developer team, and the single most active place for discussing the map's lore, asking questions about its gameplay, and organizing community events.

You can join the server at [https://discord.drehmal.net](https://discord.drehmal.net) (if that link isn't working for you, try navigating to the "Discord" tab on the main website, [drehmal.net](https://www.drehmal.net/).)

The Discord server has been active since the launch of [[Drehmal v2]] in March 2020, and currently sits at over 8900 members as of January 2025. The questions channels on this server, organized by how far into the map you are to protect players from being spoiled too badly, are the most reliable source of information and help if you're stuck somewhere or are just curious about something specific.

The Discord is also home to channels where players can discuss lore topics at length, post links to their Drehmal videos or streams, and share their Drehmal-related creations (builds, art, and more!). Additionally, upon finishing the map's main story, players will receive a password which can be input into the #completion-passphrase channel to gain access to special completion-locked channels, where you can talk about the map's many huge spoilers to your heart's content. The channel used to plan out this wiki is also locked behind the completion role, so if you want to help out or just see what went into this site, check it out!

Extremely active, knowledgeable, and helpful community members are almost always on the Discord, and if you have questions for the creators of the map, this is the place to ask!

## Reddit

Drehmal has its own subreddit, over at [r/Drehmal](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drehmal/)! This platform is not particularly active, and is more likely to spoil you, but it does exist.

## Twitter/Bluesky

The Drehmal team ran an official Twitter account beginning in 2021, at [@DrehmalMC](https://x.com/DrehmalMC). In November 2024, the dev team decided to move off of the platform indefinitely, migrating to [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/drehmal.net).

## YouTube

The Drehmal team's official YouTube channel is @Primordial-Team, found at [this link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBDJEctA0GmL6_g15kYvhMQ). Co-Creator [Rift's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@rift0110/videos) is also home to some official Drehmal content.
