# Dev Zone

The **Dev Zone** is a non-diegetic portion of the world, a large series of chunks to the far east of the main map. Some arenas, dungeons, and hub locations are actually located here (around X=27000 Z=0), but most of it is filled with test builds, planning areas, and unused assets. 

 While it is possible to clip out into the dev zone, this is **NOT** recommended, as there are important functions reliant on this area, and it is not canon to the map or intended to ever be seen.

 However, if you have finished the map and want to have a look around, there are some structures you will recognize, and it can be interesting to tour.
