# Trinkets

**Trinkets** are unique miscellaneous items found in Drehmal, mostly in story locations, which do not neatly fit into other item categories. These typically have custom sprites and models, and their item descriptions include the word "Trinket" in green.

Nearly all trinkets are heavily tied to late-game spoilers, so navigate this page with caution.

## Terminus Compasses
Four separate lodestone compasses are given to the player in the [[Terminus Network|Terminus]] compass dispensary, in the Central Towers wing. These compasses all share the same model, and are marked as trinkets. They each point towards a specific location, and are found throughout the early and mid-game, at multiple network linkage milestones. 

![[terminus_compass.gif]]{ width="300" }

The arrow on these compasses points upward when facing towards the intended destination.

### Av'Sal Locator
The Av'Sal Locator, named **Network Terminal Locator 0xAVS**, is given to the player upon the first time they enter the Terminus, and activate the Terminus by approaching the compass dispensary. It points towards the network terminal in [[Av'Sal]] that can be used to bring that area's holotexts back online.

### Sal'Mevir Locator
The Sal'Mevir Locator, named **Network Terminal Locator 0xSMV**, is given to the player upon reaching 25% network linkage. It leads the player towards the network terminal at [[Sal'Mevir]].

### Exodus Locator
The Exodus Citadel locator, named **Network Terminal Locator 0xEXC**, is given to the player upon reaching 50% network linkage. It leads the player towards the network terminal at the [[Exodus Citadel]].

### Admin Wing Locator
The Admin Wing locator, named **Network Terminal Locator 0xADM**, is given to the player upon reaching 75% network linkage. It leads the player towards the network terminal at the entrance to the [[Admin Wing]].

## Khivian Scroll of Sanctuary 
Khivian Scrolls of Sanctuary are the most common trinket in Drehmal, found as rare loot throughout the world. When used, these items will return the player to their current spawn point (either the world spawn or the most recent bed they have slept in). These are single-use items, meaning that they will disappear once they are used.

![[khive_scroll.png]]{ width="300" }

Khivian Scrolls are NBT-modified warped fungus on a stick items.

### Lore Text
> While most Tehrmari now live in permanent homes, all must, at some time in their lives, uphold the nomadic tradition. Mystic Elder Khive taught Scalebound artificers the method of constructing these scrolls long ago, and to this day, few Tehrmari travelers embark on a journey unless one is within arm's reach. 

## Relic Vessel
Relic Vessels are malleable pieces of metal that can be turned into any of the [[relics]], provided that the player attempting to do so has already received those relics once. One Relic Vessel can be found at each [[devotion]] site on [[Overworld|Drehmal]], and they can also be bought from a late-game vendor, Precocious Kinah.

Relic vessels are used by throwing them onto a Devotion altar. At this point, a menu will appear in the chat asking the player which relic they would like to claim. This can be selected by clicking on the desired item.

### Lore Text
> This simple vessel is made out of highly malleable metal. Carried by the Wingmakers to test the faith of Tehrmari Aspirants, the Aspects and Deities can easily mold it to show their favor for the holder.

## Tank Keyfob

--8<-- "50_spoiler.md"

The Tank Keyfob is a trinket found in the [[Exodus Vault]], during the 50% completion event. This trinket allows the player to exit the facility in the intended manner by firing a tank in the facility, blasting a hole in the western vault door and exiting into [[Anyr'Nogur]]. The Keyfob itself is found in a chest in the northern garage at the west end of the vault.

![[keyfob.png]]{ width="300" }

### Lore Text
> This small key looks like it will fit an Avsohmic tank. For what purpose would you need such a powerful weapon?

## Post-75% Compasses (POST-75% SPOILERS BEGIN HERE)

--8<-- "75_spoiler.md"

There are two trinkets that take the form of Terminus-style compasses found outside of the Terminus: one in the 75% event itself, and one in the Post-75% area.

### Core Security Checkpoint Locator
This compass, found in a chest on the [[Aphelion]], points towards the security checkpoint in the [[Core Facility]].

### Primal Energy Radar
This lodestone compass is found in the Core Facility, and does not tell the player where it points, only that it points towards a large concentration of primal energy. This item can be used as a strong hint towards the eventual story event that begins at the Core Facility.

??? warning "Primal Energy Radar Use"
    The Primal Energy Radar points the player towards the gate of the [[Primary Energy Collection Facility]] in [[Mt. Yavhlix]], giving the player a target for the [[Story Progression#Mythbreaker Run (LATE-GAME SPOILERS BEGIN HERE)|Mythbreaker Run]].

## Call of the Council 

Call of the Council is a trinket that can be purchased from Precocious Kinah in [[Ytaj]] for 32 Divine Baubles.

This item allows the player to fast travel directly to the Prismatic Council room in Ytaj once per in-game day.

![[prismatic_mace.gif]]{ width="300" }

### Lore Text
> After the Divine Schism, the Prismatic Council voted to tighten security around Ytaj. Kinah, a noble housecat deemed worthy of ascension, now serves as the protector of the palace. This staff was forged by Kinah to allow those she trusts deeply to enter and leave with ease, ostensibly to inform the Council of dangers outside their perception.

## Aurastaff of Permafrost

The Aurastaff of Permafrost is a trinket that can be purchased either from Precocious Kinah in [[Ytaj]] for 5 Divine Baubles. This item functions only on [[Lo'Dahr]], and prevents hostile mob spawns in a 32 block radius when placed. 

![[aurastaff.png]]{ width="300" }

### Lore Text
> Loe and Lai were once the greatest of friends, and together designed many powerful devices for the Tehrmari with divine magic from the fabled forge, Soletta. Though few in number and no longer in production, these staves are immaculately maintained and priceless to the residents of Lo'Dahr.

## End-Game Trinkets (END-GAME SPOILERS)

The following three trinkets are all given as story-driving items to point the player towards end-game locations by the [[yellow|end-game guide]].

### Silent Thing
The Silent Thing is given to the player upon their first return to the Terminus after the sequence in [[Nothing Island|The Nothing]], and it points them towards [[Azimuth Labs]].

### Rhythmic Thing

The item's description reads:
