**Pure Corruption** is one of 30 Legendary Items obtainable in Drehmal: Apotheosis.

The legendary helmet Pure Corruption is found in [[Teiruun Monastery]], and is closely tied to the contained storyline of that location. It provides very strong base stat multipliers when worn, but adds no armor points, and applies lingering negative status effects that make it difficult to use for long periods of time.

## Gameplay
Pure Corruption is an NBT-modified diamond helmet, and inherits that durability.

The helmet provides +50% boosts to max health, movement speed, attack damage, and attack speed while worn, making the wearer significantly stronger, but comes at a significant cost.

Pure Corruption provides no armor, and its special ability, Rotten Core, gives the wearer lingering hunger and poison effects, which will inevitably bring the player down to a half heart if worn for too long. Thus, Pure Corruption is best utilized for only a brief moment where its power is needed, if utilized at all.

## How to Obtain
Pure Corruption is found at [[Teiruun Monastery]], and can be seen as the culmination of that location's main storyline.

A book dropped by Abbot Balthysar ([[Letter of Thanks]]) at the top of Teiruun Monastery hints at the legendary item's location, beneath a "caged chapel." There is one chapel room in the monastery, towards its lower end, which is blocked off by iron bars. Breaking through these iron bars and then digging down through the floor reveals a staircase to a secret lab facility, guarded by several custom mobs. The trapped chest with the legendary helmet is found in the central room of this underground area.

## Lore
Teiruun Monastery was the site of significant experimentation on how a [[Drehmari]] could be ascended into a [[Virmari]], without the direct intervention of the [[Virtuo|Goddess]]. These experiments included sensory deprivation and many other means of alchemical modification on unwilling subjects and willing monks alike, but it seems that none truly managed to achieve the Virmari form.

Pure Corruption appears to be one of the failed results of these attempts.
