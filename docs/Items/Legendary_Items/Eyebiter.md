| **Lore**                      | Maelihs took advantage of the Tidal War's chaos to infiltrate the Kiln with designs to kill Virtuo. He bested her in combat, but was unable to finish the deed. Instead, he ripped her eye from its socket and took it to Rhaveloth, where it was crafted into this wicked shield. It is seen as a portent of Mael's eventual conquest of the entire realm. |

## Gameplay
Eyebiter has relatively modest stats for a custom shield, adding 15% Knockback Resistance and a small armor boost, but its real strength lies in its special ability.

The shield is able to reflect magical projectiles, including many of the custom projectiles added in Drehmal that cannot be otherwise blocked by regular shields. 

## How to Obtain
This legendary is found in the [[Sepulchral Altar]], the devotion site of [[Maelihs]] in [[Rhaveloth]]. The trapped chest is located at the very bottom of the location, at the other end of the room with the deity's [[Devotion|devotion]] shrine.

**Coordinates:** (-2806, 39, 5387)

## Lore
The shield is crafted out of the stolen eye of the goddess [[Virtuo]], after it was ripped out by [[Maelihs]] in their confrontation at the [[Kiln of Virtuo]] during the [[Tidal War]]. This was an inciting incident for the eventual fates of both deities, as Virtuo would come to lose faith in her purpose on Drehmal and leave for [[Eastern Xivrhynt]], while Maelihs eventually grew resentful of the empire he had created, and abandoned the continent for [[LD|Lo'Dahr]].

## Extras
Eyebiter is required for one late-game [[Advancements|advancement]]. At [[Ihted Academy]], the Shackled Sentinel enemies fire magical lasers at the player, and the "BE NOT AFRAID" is given for reflecting these lasers back at one (as shown in this page's gif). This can only be done using Eyebiter's special ability.
