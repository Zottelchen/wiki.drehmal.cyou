**The Heartaxe** is one of 30 Legendary Items obtainable in Drehmal: Apotheosis.

Found in the [[North Heartwood]], the Heartaxe is a combination legendary weapon and tool, which can serve as part of a heavy build or as a faster version of an axe for chopping down large quantities of logs.

| **Lore**                      | The Heartwood has always been incredibly difficult to live in because of the rapid growth rate of the flora in the region. Roots, vines and weeds completely overrun anything that is built within the forest. This axe was made by a fool who believed they could single-handedly stop the growth. |
| **Obtain**                    | In a small ruin in the [[Underwood]], a part of the [[North Heartwood]] accessed along the eastern coast of the Mouth of Drehmal.   |

## Gameplay
The Heartaxe is an NBT-modified diamond axe, and inherits the durability of a vanilla diamond axe.

The Heartaxe is best suited for a heavier build, due to the fact that it adds knockback resistance and takes away speed, in conjunction with its relatively high attack damage and low attack speed.

The axe does serve well, however, as a tool for chopping down large quantities of wood, as its ability—**Lumberlust**—gives the player the Haste effect when chopping logs. This effect lasts only for about 2 seconds, but at the top level of Haste IV, a Heartaxe enchanted with Efficiency V can effectively insta-mine logs. This ability also has no cooldown period.

## How to Obtain
The Heartaxe can be found in the [[Underwood]], a series of caverns underneath part of the [[North Heartwood]]. 

The Underwood is most easily accessed from the Mouth of Drehmal, the large inland sea in the center of the continent, from a cove along its eastern coast. The first small island in the cavern contains a ruined tower, guarded by a few custom enemies named "Templar of the Beast" or "Templar of the Heartwood." The Heartaxe is found in a trapped chest on the ground floor of this building.

This structure can also be seen from the regular surface of the Heartwood above.

## Lore
The Heartaxe's lore is mostly confined to the item description itself, which states that it was created by someone who sought to single-handedly stop the rapid growth of the Heartwood. The exact meaning of this statement is not known.
