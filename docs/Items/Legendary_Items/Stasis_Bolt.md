**Stasis Bolts** are one of 30 Legendary Items obtainable in Drehmal: Apotheosis.

The only legendary item which works as ammunition, Stasis Bolts are legendary arrows/crossbow bolts that are found in [[Khive's Domain]], awarded by the [[Khive|Mystic Elder]] after completion of his trial at the [[Mystic Gallery]].

## Gameplay
Stasis Bolts are NBT-modified tipped arrows.

Stasis Bolts can be fired from any bow or crossbow, including legendary and mythical versions thereof. Like any other unique tipped arrow, this is done by placing it towards the top left of the player's inventory, or by holding them in the player's off-hand while shooting with the main hand. On a successful hit, the target is frozen in time for approximately 2-3 seconds, often freezing in mid-air at the point that the arrow knocked them back to.

Since these bolts deal only 1 damage, they are not effective for actually killing most enemies, but they can absolutely be used to set up attacks with stronger weapons.

## How to Obtain
Stasis Bolts are given as a reward for completing Khive's Trial at the Mystic Gallery. 

For a more in-depth guide to this puzzle, see the main [[Mystic Gallery]] page.

Upon solving this puzzle, a chest will appear at the small pyramid where the trial began, containing the Stasis Bolts and the [[The Facets#Facet I|first Facet]].

## Lore
Not much is known about the lore of the Stasis Bolts themselves, but it is established through their lore text that they are carved with ancient runic magic. Khive is heavily connected to the very vague lore of the First Avihm, having brought magic to mortals in the form of [[Arcanism]] during that time, which he states in multiple points that he regrets doing. This makes the gift significant, as Khive would surely not trust these runes in the hands of an unworthy Drehmari.

## Extras
There is a known glitch with Stasis Bolts stemming from the way they affect the game's physics. If a player is affected by a stasis bolt, including one shot by themselves, then any projectile fired by them (including thrown items like a Primal Pearl or snowball, as well as projectiles like arrows) will have a significantly increased velocity. This allows for pearls to be thrown extremely long distances, which has been used in Drehmal speedrunning.
