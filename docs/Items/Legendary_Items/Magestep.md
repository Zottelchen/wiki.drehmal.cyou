The two became fast friends, and for the first time in millennia, Khive learned to trust another. Unbeknownst to the other Aspects, Yvinahl carries out a variety of secret tasks for the Aspect of Magic. |

## Gameplay
Magestep is an NBT-modified pair of diamond boots, inheriting that durability.

Magestep is relatively weak as a piece of armor, contributing less Armor than vanilla diamond boots (+3 vs. +2) and no Armor Toughness, which vanilla boots would give +2 of. However, Magestep makes up for this in its ability.

Magestep gives its wearer a lingering Jump Boost III effect, making the player able to clear a height of just over 3 blocks in a single jump. The Feather Falling II enchantment prevents fall damage from most of these jumps. As such, Magestep can be extremely useful for traversal, but is slightly weak compared to other armor options.

## How to Obtain
Magestep is located in Khive's Domain, at the very top of Ihted Academy.

For a more in-depth guide on that location, see the main [[Ihted Academy]] page.

Navigating to the top of the Academy requires that the player find their way past the Shackled Sentinel enemies, which are invulnerable but tethered to vulnerable baby zombie-type enemies, which will destroy the Sentinels if killed. The legendary is found in a room on the roof of the building, in a trapped chest near a lectern which holds the [[Codex Celestus]].

**Coordinates:** (-960, 245, -954)

## Lore
This item appears to be the only mention of Khive's disciple, Yvinahl, and moreover, it seems to imply that this disciple is still alive and actively carrying out secret tasks for the Mystic Elder.
