## Gameplay
Tul'Vohaln is an NBT-modified iron helmet, and inherits that item's base durability.

Tul'Vohaln is not particularly strong as a piece of armor alone, boasting the same amount of armor points as a vanilla iron helmet and taking away 0.015 movement speed. Its main use comes through its special ability.

Tul'Vohaln's special ability, Eyes Unclouded, is a passive ability which highlights enemies within a certain radius (approximately 5 chunks, or ~80 blocks), applying the Glowing effect to them. This effectively allows the player to see enemies in their vicinity through walls. This effect only applies to hostile mobs.

## How to Obtain
Tul'Vohaln is located at the true [[Altar of Insight]], in the [[Veruhkt Plateau]].

At the ziggurat by the Tinaxi Pools (the multicolored basins), a secret passageway can be revealed beneath the main altar by digging through it, leading down a path guarded by Golems of Insight. The player must navigate through a large cavern to the true Altar of Insight, where Tul'Vohaln is found in a trapped chest behind purple stained glass panes. These can be broken to obtain the legendary.

## Lore
Tul'Vohaln was created by the peoples of the Veruhkt Plateau region (Veruhktians), who named themselves after the hidden moon of [[Lo'Veruhkt]]. As its item description suggests, this helmet is based off of the Lens of Insight, the glass orb structure found in the room just before it. The Lens was made to peer through the body of the [[Disc]] itself in order to locate Lo'Veruhkt, and the helmet is based on that technology.
