The **AvPOD** is one of 30 Legendary Items obtainable in Drehmal: Apotheosis.

The AvPOD (short for Avsohmic Playback Organizer Device) is a legendary item that is capable of playing any individual song from the Drehmal: Apotheosis OST, as long as the player has heard it at some point (accessed the location where it plays). It is found in [[Tharxax City]], at the Lord Magister's Residence.

| **Ability**                   | **Music Player**: "*Records music as you explore. Right-click to see and play the many songs of Drehmal.*"
| **Lore**                      | Under Avsohmic rule, leisure was a privilege afforded only to the wealthy and powerful. This strange artifact passed its way through many opulent hands before ending up in yours. |
| **Obtain**                    | Located at the Lord Magister's Residence, atop the arch overlooking [[Tharxax City]].   |

## Gameplay
The AvPOD functions only for the player that is holding it, with its menu being contained to the in-game chat. The menu contains 4 main options:

- **Browse Soundtracks**: Browses through all songs you have discovered. Click this option to see all your unlocked songs, and click any one of them to play it. <br>
- **Browse Playlists**: Browses through any playlists you have created of the songs you have unlocked. <br>
- **Make Playlist**: Allows you to create a playlist out of your discovered songs. Enter Editing Mode to add these songs, then return to the playlist creation screen to save and use it with the above option. <br>
- **Play Random**: Plays any random track out of those you have unlocked.

Music volume, as is the case with most of these tracks, is determined by the Locational Music volume slider.

The AvPOD works in the vast majority of the world, but is disabled in certain areas, giving the message:

> [ERR_0xran0] out of service range, unable to establish AvLib connection

When back in range, the message "Back Online!" will appear in chat.

AvPOD is disabled only in very specific areas, almost entirely belonging to late-game story sequences. See the Extras section for a full (SPOILER) list of locations where AvPOD is confirmed to be disabled.

## How to Obtain
The AvPOD is found in a chest on a table in the Lord Magister's Residence, a large building on the arch that overlooks [[Tharxax City]].

**Coordinates:** (-2113, 119, 3582)
