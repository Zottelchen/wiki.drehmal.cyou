# Relics

Relics are items obtained via [devotion[Devotion], gifted as rewards for reaching certain milestones. Each [Aspect or deity[Higher Beings]] has their own respective relic, of which there are 4 levels (typically indicated by a +0 to +3 after the item name) that are given separately at different levels of devotion. Each level increases the stat boosts granted by the item and changes the sprite. Relic items work only when placed in the offhand slot.
