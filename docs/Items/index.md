Spread throughout the map of Drehmal are many custom, unique items, each with their own special modifiers or abilities accommodating different styles of gameplay. They also almost always have their own lore, explained by their descriptions. Along with [written books](/Lore/Books/), item descriptions play a large part in communicating the lore of Drehmal. Most custom items can be grouped into one of several classes, indicated by text on its tooltip.

## [[Relics|Relic]]

Relics are offhand, stat-modifying items that are obtained via [[Devotion|devotion]]. Each type of relic has 4 different leveled versions. Relics have their own sprites and item descriptons that often explain bits of lore pertaining to its related Aspect or deity.

## [[Artifacts|Artifact]]

Artifacts are uncommon items found throughout the map, most often in chests. Most artifacts have their own custom stat modifiers and item descriptions, which ususally detail an item's lore.

## [[Artisan Items|Artisan]]

Artisan items are similar to artifacts (they have stat modifiers and descriptions), but they are sold by [[Runic Blacksmiths|Runic Blacksmith]] or one of its variants.

## [Legendary](/Items/Legendary_Items)
