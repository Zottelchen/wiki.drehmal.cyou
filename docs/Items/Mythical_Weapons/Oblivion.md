**Oblivion** is one of 8 Mythical Weapons obtainable in Drehmal: Apotheosis.

??? warning "Quest Guide"
    **Suggested Items:** Potions of Night Vision, Food, Weapons, General Adventuring Items

    Enter the Palace Staff Quarters in the Tidal Palace in [[Firteid]], and continue until the sign that says DANGER! Malfunctioning elevator and chasm. Break through and drop down the chasm, ladders and/or water bucket suggested. At the bottom is a nearly pitch black tunnel filled with monsters, fight through and follow it to the end - a room with a chest. Inside this chest will be the Compass of Nihility, which points north from this spot.

    If you have the tower, teleport to The [[Frozen Bite]], if not, follow the compass from whichever tower you have that is most north east on your map. The compass leads to an abandoned house with a few mobs and spawners. Search the house thoroughly for lore books, other unique items, and specifically a chest with [[Nihilist's Notes]]. Make sure to take a copy, and head to Mt. Yavhlix as mentioned in the notes.

    If you've been to the doors before, the location the notes refers to is slightly south west of the doors, and marked with a stone pillar with a sea lantern on top. Throw a copy of the Nihilist's Notes onto the black concrete which opens a hole. Jump down and you will be met with a dark labyrinth. You can mine through some walls, but the labyrinth is solvable and leads to a chest with Oblivion.
