**Oblivion** is one of 8 Mythical Weapons obtainable in Drehmal: Apotheosis.

A scythe wielded by a cryptic, hooded figure known as The Pawn, Oblivion is found through a paper trail beginning in the castle at [[Highfall]], taking the player on a journey throughout the northeastern portion of the continent.

## Gameplay
Oblivion is a heavily NBT-customized netherite sword.

Oblivion encourages a somewhat faster playstyle, giving the player extra movement speed and holding higher than average attack speed with competitive damage output. The Sweeping Edge IX enchantment, 3 times higher than the normal vanilla limit of Sweeping Edge III, makes the weapon extremely strong against tight clusters of enemies. Practically, this translates to sweeping attacks dealing 90% of the attack's initial damage to other entities in range, meaning it can hit large groups of enemies for near-full damage at once.

Oblivion's special ability, Force of Nothing, allows its user to pick up a single enemy, hold them in the air, move them around while draining their health, and launch them forward by crouching. This ability only works on one enemy at a time, and does not work on some larger or stronger enemies, but can be incredibly effective for controlling the pace of a fight, or removing something from a fight entirely.

??? warning "Late-Game Spoilers: Upgrades"
    Like the other Mythicals, Oblivion can be upgraded with one of each Fervor Stone at the Soletta, increasing its health, cooldown, and movement speed bonuses. A fully upgraded Oblivion grants the player +4 Max Health (+2 Hearts) and +0.03 Movement Speed, and has a special ability cooldown of only 30 seconds.

## How to Obtain
Oblivion is obtained through a questline that pushes the player to follow a trail of hints from one of Drehmal's major towns to a hidden structure that houses the mythical weapon.

Oblivion's quest begins underneath the castle at the town of [[Highfall]] in the northeast of [[Overworld|Drehmal]]. Within this castle, a tight, cramped, narrow side room ends in an iron trapdoor, covering a ladder down to a cavern beneath the castle. This cavern, when followed, constricts into a pitch-black tunnel. This winding tunnel, which stretches on for over 700 blocks, eventually culminates in a colorful pocket of concrete, with a single chest hidden behind a wall. This chest contains a stack of Nihilist's Compass items, which are calibrated to lead the player to a point toward the north.

The compass points toward an abandoned building in the northeast of the [[Frozen Bite]] region. The lodestone it is attuned to is found in a small attic room at the very top of the house, along with a chest containing a stack of [[Nihilist's Notes]]. This piece of paper has the following description:

> The Gaping Hole <br>
> Its origin unsaid <br>
> Close to the northern pole <br>
> Lies Mt. Yavhlix, place of dread <br>
> South of its summit <br>
> A lantern of sea <br>
> One must plummet <br>
> And you will see 

This hints toward the final location in the questline, outside of [[Mt. Yavhlix]].

At Mt. Yavhlix, south-southwest of the mountain's summit, a small stone brick platform with a single sea lantern atop it can be found. Here, there are two signs, which read: <br>
> Feed the notes of a nihilist into the blackest of voids <br>
> Throw yourself into the emptiest abyss

By throwing a copy of the Nihilist's Notes onto the piece of black concrete at the platform, the player will open a shaft downwards. Jumping into this shaft will bring the player to the final obstacle in their path: a labyrinth.

The labyrinth is dark and patrolled by custom enemies named "Emissary's Shade." It is recommended to bring torches or another source of light, as well as something to mark where you have explored. There are useful items found in chests throughout the labyrinth, including a [[Fervor Stone]], but there is only one correct path out to Oblivion. When found, it can be picked up via right clicking.

Oblivion is the scythe used by the Pawn of Nothing, better known as the [[Emissary of the Void]]. In the final boss fight of the map, the Emissary wields a copy of Oblivion against you. It is unclear which Oblivion—the one used by the Emissary at the end of the game or the copy the player can find beneath Mt. Yavhlix—is the original. The weapon's exact origin is unclear, but it seems that it was gifted to the Emissary by [[yellow|The Mythoclast]] when the former entered his service after dying and reaching the [[Court of Nothing]]. 

As suggested by the lore text of the scythe itself, there are multiple accounts of the Emissary wielding Oblivion during the final day of Avsohm. [[The Omen]], a book found buried in the ruins of Old Elvett, contains one such account of seeing the Emissary at the author's bar, and a hidden room in the [[Stasis Facility]] shows recorded security footage of the Emissary wielding Oblivion in the stasis chamber room.
