**Ascendance** is one of 8 Mythical Weapons obtainable in Drehmal: Apotheosis.

??? warning "Dungeon Guide"
    **Suggested Items:** Armor, Shield, Ranged Weapon, Building Blocks, Bed to set respawn, Food for healing

    Once you enter the [[Moonlight Sanctum]] you will be inflicted with mining fatigue. Find a tower with a door and button, enter, and kill the Undead Theocracy Archers. Once the room is clear, look below at the floor and shoot through the holes to kill the Elder Guardian. Repeat for the remaining 2 towers, 3 in total. Once the Elder Guardians are dead, head to the bridge and press the button:

    _[Ascendant Voice] Elders slain. Magic ward lifted._

    Before you head down the bridge, there is a trapped chest in the center of the cave. You can now break through and retrieve the paper named _Ancient Theocracy Rites_.

    Continue down the bridge and break the glass to continue into the next room. You will be met with a sign that says THE FIRST OF EACH RITE IS THE WAY TO THE LIGHT. Refer to the _Ancient Theocracy Rites_ and the first letter of each line. Line up the arrows to match and the puzzle is solved.
