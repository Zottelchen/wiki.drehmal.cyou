| **Lore**                         | In the aftermath of mutual slaughter of all three clans at Mt. Narukin, the legendary Osaigah bladesmith Irtheis crafted this sinister army-killing blade while surrounded by burning prisoners. Tens of thousands of deaths later, it was melted down and split into five fragments, which were hidden throughout the land. |
| **Obtain**                       | Find the 5 missing Fragments of the weapon scattered across the island of [[Sahd]] and throw them in the forge at the volcano on the island.             |
