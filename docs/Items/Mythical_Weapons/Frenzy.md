**Frenzy** is one of 8 Mythical Weapons obtainable in Drehmal: Apotheosis.

A mystical katana forged out of the condensed hate and suffering of the people of [[Sahd]], and a blade that claimed thousands of lives itself, Frenzy must be re-forged by the player from its 5 pieces, scattered across the island region.

## Gameplay
Frenzy is best suited for a fast-paced, highly aggressive playstyle, giving the player movement speed buffs, a max health penalty, and quick attacks with weak base damage. It is built around its special ability, which allows its damage to increase to 19 per attack (nearly double its base damage) indefinitely, so long as the player is able to continuously kill enemies. This makes Frenzy incredibly powerful against large groups of weaker enemies, but somewhat ineffective against much stronger enemies that are fought alone.

Frenzy's special ability, Fatal Rampage, increases its base damage by 3 on a successful kill, stacking up to 3 times for a total of 19 damage per hit. This effect lasts for 6 seconds within each tier, reverting to the next lowest tier if another kill is not made during that window. Kills with +9 damage active reset the timer. If the timer runs out while in Tier 1 (+3 damage), the ability goes on cooldown.

??? warning "Late-Game Spoilers: Upgrades"
    Like the other Mythicals, Frenzy can be upgraded with one of each Fervor Stone at the Soletta, increasing its health, cooldown, and movement speed bonuses. A fully upgraded Frenzy takes away only 2 Max Health (-1 Heart), grants +0.04 Movement Speed, and has a special ability cooldown of 45 seconds.

## How to Obtain
After Frenzy's reign of terror in Sahd, it was melted down into five pieces and scattered across the region, and these pieces remain hidden to this day. The player must find all five of these fragments and toss them into the forge at the volcanic caldera in the north of the island in order to reunite them into the blade itself.

These fragments have different custom models, but share the same lore text:

> Sahd's legends speak of a frenzied weapon that was split into five fragments, hidden across the island of Sahd. It is said that a powerful, runic forge exists somewhere on the island, perched within the caldera of a volcano. Toss all five fragments into the red bricked forge to recreate the mythical blade.

### Fragment of Fury ![[fragment_of_fury.gif]]{ width="48" }
The Fragment of Fury takes the form of a flaming stone. It is the only fragment not found on the main island of Sahd. It is a re-skinned piece of black dye.

??? warning "Fragment Location"
    Off the eastern coast of the island, multiple smaller islands can be found. The largest of these, which boasts a large pink hill, is home to a dock and a small tower, inhabited by [[Mihkmari]]. In the room at the top of this tower is a chest with the fragment. <br>
    **Coordinates:** (5493, 93, 5834)

### Fragment of Hate ![[fragment_of_hate.gif]]{ width="48" }
The Fragment of Hate takes the form of a sharp metal fragment, in a shape reminiscent of a shark tooth, perpetually dripping blood. It is found within the region's main town, [[New Sahd]]. It is a reskinned iron nugget.

??? warning "Fragment Location"
    The Fragment of Hate is found in a building at the docks of New Sahd. It is located within a chest on its top floor. <br>
    **Coordinates:** (4709, 81, 5827)

### Fragment of Pain ![[fragment_of_pain.gif]]{ width="48" }
The Fragment of Pain takes the form of a yellow-orange object with jagged borders, emitting particles. It is found within the [[Emperor's Estate]]. It is a re-skinned piece of blaze powder.

??? warning "Fragment Location"
    The fragment is found in a chest at the very top room of the Estate, navigated to by climbing up the chandelier in the center of the main hallway. <br>
    **Coordinates:** (5104, 177, 6323)

### Fragment of Rage ![[fragment_of_rage.gif]]{ width="48" }
The Fragment of Rage takes the form of a golden tear with a pulsating glow. It is found northwest of New Sahd, in the mountains. The item is a re-skinned gold nugget. 

??? warning "Fragment Location"
    The Fragment of Rage is found in a chest within a small shrine to [[Moen]], Aspect of Pleasure, atop a mountain in northwestern Sahd. <br>
    **Coordinates:** (4589, 220, 5418)

### Fragment of Wrath ![[fragment_of_wrath.gif]]{ width="48" }
The Fragment of Wrath takes the form of a dark sheet with a ghostly face emblazoned upon it. It is found in the south of the swamp/marsh biome that makes up the southwestern portion of the island, and is tied to a riddle. It is a re-skinned nether brick.

The riddle reads: <br>
> I can feed you <br>
> I can be valuable <br>
> I give protection <br>
> I grant life <br>
> 
> Toss me into the orange ring


??? warning "Fragment Location"
    The riddle refers to an item that can be eaten and is valuable, which matches the description of a golden apple. Tossing a golden apple in the middle of the ring of orange carpets will spawn a chest holding this fragment. <br>
    **Coordinates:** (4488, 64, 6540)

### Bell Shrine
On a beach along Sahd's eastern coast, the player can find a small shrine with five large bells, each of which is labeled with a sign corresponding to one of the fragments. If the player is unable to locate one of the fragments, or has lost one, then throwing a Soul Asteria (Nether Star) into the ring beneath that respective bell will create a new copy of that fragment.

**Shrine Coordinates:** (5356, 63, 6047)

### Forge
Once all five fragments have been collected, the player can head to the volcanic caldera forge in the island's northern portion to reassemble the blade. Throwing all five fragments into the forge at once (on top of the magma blocks) will summon Frenzy, embedded in the magma blocks.

## Lore
The island of [[Sahd]] was very well-known in Drehmal for its bloody wars, and Frenzy lies at the core of that history. As its lore text implies, the weapon was first forged by a member of the Osaigah clan, one of the three main warring clans on the island in Av2, imbuing it with the collective suffering and hate of the clan's prisoners. The weapon was, as stated, used to claim tens of thousands of lives, and after the wars had ceased, it was melted into five separate pieces for safeguarding, spread throughout the island.

There were unsuccessful attempts to reunite the blade's pieces before the player did so, as seen at the [[Emperor's Estate]]. Here, where the Fragment of Pain was kept, bandits encircled the estate for months, attempting to siege it and claim the fragment inside. This did not come to pass, as instead, the emperor cast a spell on the bandits that turned them into undead soldiers, forced to guard the estate and its fragment forever. These are the very same enemies found in the estate by the player.
