**Calamity** is one of 8 Mythical Weapons obtainable in Drehmal: Apotheosis.

Found at the Epicenter of the Desolation in the [[South Heartwood]] region, Calamity is dropped by [[Ossein|Skull Disciple Ossein]] upon his defeat. It gives the single largest movement speed buff of any item in the game, allowing for a quick and devastating melee build.

Though Ossein carved numerous armaments from the bones of Skullbeasts, he carried a special affection for the claw of his beloved Femura. |

## Gameplay
Calamity functions like a sword (technically being a netherite sword) with significant stat boosts. Its base-level attack damage is relatively weak compared to the other mythical weapons, but it can make up for this defect with its high attack speed and excellent movement speed buff. Out of any one item in Drehmal, Calamity boasts the single largest movement speed buff that the player can receive, at +0.07 speed (a 70% increase from the baseline speed of 0.1.) This makes it incredibly useful not only for strafing, evasion, and quickly closing distance in combat, but also for traversal.

Calamity's ability, True Catastrophe, is a strong AoE attack that can greatly damage and even kill multiple weaker enemies at a time. In the 2.1 version of Drehmal, Calamity's ability paused for longer at the peak of the jump, and could be canceled by scrolling off of the weapon at the peak. This does not appear to be possible in 2.2, as the attack is locked in once the jump begins, and spends less time at the apex.

??? warning "Late-Game Spoilers: Upgrades"
    Like the other Mythicals, Calamity can be upgraded with one of each Fervor Stone at the Soletta, increasing its health, cooldown, and movement speed bonuses. A fully upgraded Calamity does not take any health from the player, adds +0.08 Movement Speed, and has a special ability cooldown of only 30 seconds.

## How to Obtain

Calamity is dropped by Ossein, an optional boss found in [[South Heartwood|Mael's Desolation]]. In the southwest of the Heartwood lies the Epicenter of the Desolation, a gigantic black crater in the west of the burnt, barren portion of the region. At this crater's center, an arena of bone blocks can be found, with a small shrine at its center. Pressing the button on the shrine will transport the player to Ossein's arena, initiating his boss battle. For more detailed information on this fight, see [[Ossein|Ossein's page]].

Ossein uses Calamity against the player during their fight. Once he has been slain, he drops the weapon.

## Lore

Calamity's lore text heavily implies that it is the claw of a Skullbeast named Femura. The Skullbeasts were nightmarish, skeletal creatures unleashed by [[Maelihs]] in his conquest of Western Drehmal. Skullbeasts were effectively unkillable for the Drehmari of that time, and while many grew to fear their power, others became enamored by it. Ossein was one such person, known as a Skull Disciple. He became particularly obsessed with Femura, one of the Skullbeasts, and made a pilgrimage to the [[Birthing Grounds]] to attempt a ritual to revive her.

Ossein was unsuccessful in this endeavor, but at some point (possibly during his time at the Birthing Grounds), he obtained the claw of Femura, which we know as Calamity.
