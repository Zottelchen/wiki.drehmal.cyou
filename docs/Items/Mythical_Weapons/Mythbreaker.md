    | **Lore**                             | While perfect in form, it is clear that the weapon lacks something. A blade with such infinite potential should not go to waste. |

    | **Ability**                          | **Core Collapse**: "*Hold down right click for an extended period to collapse the innumerable possibilities before you into an impossibly strong blast of primal energy.*" <br> If successfully used without being interrupted, this ability can deal up to 150 damage, although this can be difficult to pull off. <br> **Cooldown:** 60s (shortened to 15s if interrupted mid-use). |
    | **Lore**                             | Seemingly infinite power arcs across this blade, burning your hands and quaking the ground beneath your feet. It seems as if reality itself wavers as the rawest form of existence seeps into the space around you. |

    | **Lore**                             | In the endless cosmos beyond the veil, there exists the primordial battle between fundamental forces. Trillions of realms, held together by the hopeful defiance of entropy, ultimately nothing more than a balancing act in the face of inevitable, muted chaos. Those that fight to control it always forfeit their right to existence. |
